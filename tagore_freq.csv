Chapter One

Bimala s Story

I


"MOTHER, today there comes back to mind the vermilion mark [1] at"
"the parting of your hair, the   sari   [2] which you used to"
"wear, with its wide red border, and those wonderful eyes of"
"yours, full of depth and peace.  They came at the start of my"
"life s journey, like the first streak of dawn, giving me golden"
provision to carry me on my way.

"The sky which gives light is blue, and my mother s face was dark,"
"but she had the radiance of holiness, and her beauty would put to"
shame all the vanity of the beautiful.

Everyone says that I resemble my mother.  In my childhood I used
to resent this.  It made me angry with my mirror.  I thought that
it was God s unfairness which was wrapped round my limbs--that my
"dark features were not my due, but had come to me by some"
misunderstanding.  All that remained for me to ask of my God in
"reparation was, that I might grow up to be a model of what woman"
"should be, as one reads it in some epic poem."

"When the proposal came for my marriage, an astrologer was sent,"
"who consulted my palm and said,  This girl has good signs.  She"
will become an ideal wife. 

"And all the women who heard it said:  No wonder, for she"
resembles her mother. 

"I was married into a Rajah s house.  When I was a child, I was"
quite familiar with the description of the Prince of the fairy
story.  But my husband s face was not of a kind that one s
"imagination would place in fairyland.  It was dark, even as mine"
"was.  The feeling of shrinking, which I had about my own lack of"
"physical beauty, was lifted a little; at the same time a touch of"
regret was left lingering in my heart.

But when the physical appearance evades the scrutiny of our
"senses and enters the sanctuary of our hearts, then it can forget"
"itself.  I know, from my childhood s experience, how devotion is"
"beauty itself, in its inner aspect.  When my mother arranged the"
"different fruits, carefully peeled by her own loving hands, on"
"the white stone plate, and gently waved her fan to drive away the"
"flies while my father sat down to his meals, her service would"
lose itself in a beauty which passed beyond outward forms.  Even
in my infancy I could feel its power.  It transcended all
"debates, or doubts, or calculations: it was pure music."

"I distinctly remember after my marriage, when, early in the"
"morning, I would cautiously and silently get up and take the dust"
"[3] of my husband s feet without waking him, how at such moments"
I could feel the vermilion mark upon my forehead shining out like
the morning star.

"One day, he happened to awake, and smiled as he asked me:  What"
"is that, Bimala?  What   are   you doing? "

I can never forget the shame of being detected by him.  He might
possibly have thought that I was trying to earn merit secretly.
"But no, no!  That had nothing to do with merit.  It was my"
"woman s heart, which must worship in order to love."

My father-in-law s house was old in dignity from the days of the
  Badshahs  .  Some of its manners were of the Moguls and
"Pathans, some of its customs of Manu and Parashar.  But my"
husband was absolutely modern.  He was the first of the house to
go through a college course and take his M.A.  degree.  His elder
"brother had died young, of drink, and had left no children.  My"
husband did not drink and was not given to dissipation.  So
"foreign to the family was this abstinence, that to many it hardly"
"seemed decent!  Purity, they imagined, was only becoming in those"
on whom fortune had not smiled.  It is the moon which has room
"for stains, not the stars."

"My husband s parents had died long ago, and his old grandmother"
"was mistress of the house.  My husband was the apple of her eye,"
the jewel on her bosom.  And so he never met with much difficulty
in overstepping any of the ancient usages.  When he brought in
"Miss Gilby, to teach me and be my companion, he stuck to his"
resolve in spite of the poison secreted by all the wagging
tongues at home and outside.

My husband had then just got through his B.A.  examination and
was reading for his M.A.  degree; so he had to stay in Calcutta
"to attend college.  He used to write to me almost every day, a"
"few lines only, and simple words, but his bold, round handwriting"
"would look up into my face, oh, so tenderly!  I kept his letters"
in a sandalwood box and covered them every day with the flowers I
gathered in the garden.

"At that time the Prince of the fairy tale had faded, like the"
moon in the morning light.  I had the Prince of my real world
enthroned in my heart.  I was his queen.  I had my seat by his
"side.  But my real joy was, that my true place was at his feet."

"Since then, I have been educated, and introduced to the modern"
"age in its own language, and therefore these words that I write"
seem to blush with shame in their prose setting.  Except for my
"acquaintance with this modern standard of life, I should know,"
"quite naturally, that just as my being born a woman was not in my"
"own hands, so the element of devotion in woman s love is not like"
a hackneyed passage quoted from a romantic poem to be piously
written down in round hand in a school-girl s copy-book.

But my husband would not give me any opportunity for worship.
That was his greatness.  They are cowards who claim absolute
devotion from their wives as their right; that is a humiliation
for both.

His love for me seemed to overflow my limits by its flood of
wealth and service.  But my necessity was more for giving than
"for receiving; for love is a vagabond, who can make his flowers"
"bloom in the wayside dust, better than in the crystal jars kept"
in the drawing-room.

My husband could not break completely with the old-time
"traditions which prevailed in our family.  It was difficult,"
"therefore, for us to meet at any hour of the day we pleased.  [4]"
"I knew exactly the time that he could come to me, and therefore"
our meeting had all the care of loving preparation.  It was like
the rhyming of a poem; it had to come through the path of the
metre.

"After finishing the day s work and taking my afternoon bath, I"
would do up my hair and renew my vermilion mark and put on my
"  sari  , carefully crinkled; and then, bringing back my body"
"and mind from all distractions of household duties, I would"
"dedicate it at this special hour, with special ceremonies, to one"
"individual.  That time, each day, with him was short; but it was"
infinite.

"My husband used to say, that man and wife are equal in love"
because of their equal claim on each other.  I never argued the
"point with him, but my heart said that devotion never stands in"
the way of true equality; it only raises the level of the ground
of meeting.  Therefore the joy of the higher equality remains
permanent; it never slides down to the vulgar level of triviality.

"My beloved, it was worthy of you that you never expected worship"
"from me.  But if you had accepted it, you would have done me a"
"real service.  You showed your love by decorating me, by"
"educating me, by giving me what I asked for, and what I did not."
I have seen what depth of love there was in your eyes when you
gazed at me.  I have known the secret sigh of pain you suppressed
in your love for me.  You loved my body as if it were a flower of
paradise.  You loved my whole nature as if it had been given you
by some rare providence.

Such lavish devotion made me proud to think that the wealth was
all my own which drove you to my gate.  But vanity such as this
only checks the flow of free surrender in a woman s love.  When I
"sit on the queen s throne and claim homage, then the claim only"
goes on magnifying itself; it is never satisfied.  Can there be
any real happiness for a woman in merely feeling that she has
power over a man?  To surrender one s pride in devotion is
woman s only salvation.

"It comes back to me today how, in the days of our happiness, the"
"fires of envy sprung up all around us.  That was only natural,"
"for had I not stepped into my good fortune by a mere chance, and"
without deserving it?  But providence does not allow a run of
"luck to last for ever, unless its debt of honour be fully paid,"
"day by day, through many a long day, and thus made secure.  God"
"may grant us gifts, but the merit of being able to take and hold"
them must be our own.  Alas for the boons that slip through
unworthy hands!

My husband s grandmother and mother were both renowned for their
beauty.  And my widowed sister-in-law was also of a beauty rarely
"to be seen.  When, in turn, fate left them desolate, the"
grandmother vowed she would not insist on having beauty for her
remaining grandson when he married.  Only the auspicious marks
with which I was endowed gained me an entry into this family--
"otherwise, I had no claim to be here."

"In this house of luxury, but few of its ladies had received their"
"meed of respect.  They had, however, got used to the ways of the"
"family, and managed to keep their heads above water, buoyed up by"
"their dignity as   Ranis   of an ancient house, in spite of"
"their daily tears being drowned in the foam of wine, and by the"
tinkle of the  dancing girls  anklets.  Was the credit due to me
"that my husband did not touch liquor, nor squander his manhood in"
the markets of woman s flesh?  What charm did I know to soothe
"the wild and wandering mind of men?  It was my good luck, nothing"
else.  For fate proved utterly callous to my sister-in-law.  Her
"festivity died out, while yet the evening was early, leaving the"
light of her beauty shining in vain over empty halls--burning and
"burning, with no accompanying music!"

His sister-in-law affected a contempt for my husband s modern
"notions.  How absurd to keep the family ship, laden with all the"
"weight of its time-honoured glory, sailing under the colours of"
his slip of a girl-wife alone!  Often have I felt the lash of
scorn.   A thief who had stolen a husband s love!    A sham
hidden in the shamelessness of her new-fangled finery!   The
many-coloured garments of modern fashion with which my husband
loved to adorn me roused jealous wrath.   Is not she ashamed to
"make a show-window of herself--and with her looks, too! "

"My husband was aware of all this, but his gentleness knew no"
bounds.  He used to implore me to forgive her.

"I remember I once told him:  Women s minds are so petty, so"
"crooked!    Like the feet of Chinese women,  he replied.   Has"
not the pressure of society cramped them into pettiness and
crookedness?  They are but pawns of the fate which gambles with
them.  What responsibility have they of their own? 

My sister-in-law never failed to get from my husband whatever she
wanted.  He did not stop to consider whether her requests were
right or reasonable.  But what exasperated me most was that she
was not grateful for this.  I had promised my husband that I
"would not talk back at her, but this set me raging all the more,"
"inwardly.  I used to feel that goodness has a limit, which, if"
"passed, somehow seems to make men cowardly.  Shall I tell the"
whole truth?  I have often wished that my husband had the
manliness to be a little less good.

"My sister-in-law, the Bara Rani, [5] was still young and had no"
"pretensions to saintliness.  Rather, her talk and jest and laugh"
inclined to be forward.  The young maids with whom she surrounded
herself were also impudent to a degree.  But there was none to
gainsay her--for was not this the custom of the house?  It seemed
to me that my good fortune in having a stainless husband was a
"special eyesore to her.  He, however, felt more the sorrow of her"
lot than the defects of her character.

1. The mark of Hindu wifehood and the symbol of all the devotion
that it implies.

2. The   sari   is the dress of the Hindu woman.

3. Taking the dust of the feet is a formal offering of reverence
and is done by lightly touching the feet of the revered one and
then one s own head with the same hand.  The wife does not
ordinarily do this to the husband.

4. It would not be reckoned good form for the husband to be
"continually going into the zenana, except at particular hours for"
meals or rest.

5.   Bara   = Senior;   Chota   = Junior.  In joint
"families of rank, though the widows remain entitled only to a"
"life-interest in their husbands  share, their rank remains to"
"them according to seniority, and the titles  Senior  and  Junior "
"continue to distinguish the elder and younger branches, even"
though the junior branch be the one in power.

My husband was very eager to take me out of   purdah  .  [6]

One day I said to him:  What do I want with the outside world? 

" The outside world may want you,  he replied."

" If the outside world has got on so long without me, it may go on"
for some time longer.  It need not pine to death for want of me. 

" Let it perish, for all I care!  That is not troubling me.  I am"
thinking about myself. 

" Oh, indeed.  Tell me what about yourself? "

"My husband was silent, with a smile."

"I knew his way, and protested at once:  No, no, you are not going"
to run away from me like that!  I want to have this out with
you. 

 Can one ever finish a subject with words? 

 Do stop speaking in riddles.  Tell me... 

" What I want is, that I should have you, and you should have me,"
more fully in the outside world.  That is where we are still in
debt to each other. 

" Is anything wanting, then, in the love we have here at home? "

" Here you are wrapped up in me.  You know neither what you have,"
nor what you want. 

 I cannot bear to hear you talk like this. 

 I would have you come into the heart of the outer world and meet
"reality.  Merely going on with your household duties, living all"
your life in the world of household conventions and the drudgery
"of household tasks--you were not made for that!  If we meet, and"
"recognize each other, in the real world, then only will our love"
be true. 

 If there be any drawback here to our full recognition of each
"other, then I have nothing to say.  But as for myself, I feel no"
want. 

" Well, even if the drawback is only on my side, why shouldn t you"
help to remove it? 

Such discussions repeatedly occurred.  One day he said:  The
greedy man who is fond of his fish stew has no compunction in
cutting up the fish according to his need.  But the man who loves
the fish wants to enjoy it in the water; and if that is
impossible he waits on the bank; and even if he comes back home
without a sight of it he has the consolation of knowing that the
fish is all right.  Perfect gain is the best of all; but if that
"is impossible, then the next best gain is perfect losing. "

"I never liked the way my husband had of talking on this subject,"
but that is not the reason why I refused to leave the zenana.
His grandmother was still alive.  My husband had filled more than
a hundred and twenty per cent of the house with the twentieth
"century, against her taste; but she had borne it uncomplaining."
"She would have borne it, likewise, if the daughter-in-law [7] of"
the Rajah s house had left its seclusion.  She was even prepared
for this happening.  But I did not consider it important enough
to give her the pain of it.  I have read in books that we are
"called  caged birds .  I cannot speak for others, but I had so"
much in this cage of mine that there was not room for it in the
universe--at least that is what I then felt.

"The grandmother, in her old age, was very fond of me.  At the"
"bottom of her fondness was the thought that, with the conspiracy"
"of favourable stars which attended me, I had been able to attract"
my husband s love.  Were not men naturally inclined to plunge
"downwards?  None of the others, for all their beauty, had been"
able to prevent their husbands going headlong into the burning
depths which consumed and destroyed them.  She believed that I
"had been the means of extinguishing this fire, so deadly to the"
"men of the family.  So she kept me in the shelter of her bosom,"
and trembled if I was in the least bit unwell.

His grandmother did not like the dresses and ornaments my husband
brought from European shops to deck me with.  But she reflected:
" Men will have some absurd hobby or other, which is sure to be"
expensive.  It is no use trying to check their extravagance; one
is glad enough if they stop short of ruin.  If my Nikhil had not
been busy dressing up his wife there is no knowing whom else he
might have spent his money on!   So whenever any new dress of
mine arrived she used to send for my husband and make merry over
it.

Thus it came about that it was her taste which changed.  The
"influence of the modern age fell so strongly upon her, that her"
evenings refused to pass if I did not tell her stories out of
English books.

"After his grandmother s death, my husband wanted me to go and"
live with him in Calcutta.  But I could not bring myself to do
"that.  Was not this our House, which she had kept under her"
sheltering care through all her trials and troubles?  Would not a
curse come upon me if I deserted it and went off to town?  This
"was the thought that kept me back, as her empty seat"
reproachfully looked up at me.  That noble lady had come into
"this house at the age of eight, and had died in her seventy-ninth"
year.  She had not spent a happy life.  Fate had hurled shaft
"after shaft at her breast, only to draw out more and more the"
imperishable spirit within.  This great house was hallowed with
"her tears.  What should I do in the dust of Calcutta, away from"
it?

My husband s idea was that this would be a good opportunity for
leaving to my sister-in-law the consolation of ruling over the
"household, giving our life, at the same time, more room to branch"
out in Calcutta.  That is just where my difficulty came in.  She
"had worried my life out, she ill brooked my husband s happiness,"
and for this she was to be rewarded!  And what of the day when we
should have to come back here?  Should I then get back my seat at
the head?

 What do you want with that seat?   my husband would say.   Are
there not more precious things in life? 

Men never understand these things.  They have their nests in the
outside world; they little know the whole of what the household
stands for.  In these matters they ought to follow womanly
guidance.  Such were my thoughts at that time.

"I felt the real point was, that one ought to stand up for one s"
"rights.  To go away, and leave everything in the hands of the"
"enemy, would be nothing short of owning defeat."

But why did not my husband compel me to go with him to Calcutta?
"I know the reason.  He did not use his power, just because he had"
it.

"IF one had to fill in, little by little, the gap between day and"
"night, it would take an eternity to do it.  But the sun rises and"
the darkness is dispelled--a moment is sufficient to overcome an
infinite distance.

One day there came the new era of   Swadeshi   [8] in Bengal;
"but as to how it happened, we had no distinct vision.  There was"
no gradual slope connecting the past with the present.  For that
"reason, I imagine, the new epoch came in like a flood, breaking"
down the dykes and sweeping all our prudence and fear before it.
"We had no time even to think about, or understand, what had"
"happened, or what was about to happen."

"My sight and my mind, my hopes and my desires, became red with"
"the passion of this new age.  Though, up to this time, the walls"
of the home--which was the ultimate world to my mind--remained
"unbroken, yet I stood looking over into the distance, and I heard"
"a voice from the far horizon, whose meaning was not perfectly"
"clear to me, but whose call went straight to my heart."

From the time my husband had been a college student he had been
trying to get the things required by our people produced in our
own country.  There are plenty of date trees in our district.  He
tried to invent an apparatus for extracting the juice and boiling
"it into sugar and treacle.  I heard that it was a great success,"
only it extracted more money than juice.  After a while he came
to the conclusion that our attempts at reviving our industries
"were not succeeding for want of a bank of our own.  He was, at"
"the time, trying to teach me political economy.  This alone would"
"not have done much harm, but he also took it into his head to"
"teach his countrymen ideas of thrift, so as to pave the way for a"
bank; and then he actually started a small bank.  Its high rate
"of interest, which made the villagers flock so enthusiastically"
"to put in their money, ended by swamping the bank altogether."

The old officers of the estate felt troubled and frightened.
"There was jubilation in the enemy s camp.  Of all the family,"
only my husband s grandmother remained unmoved.  She would scold
"me, saying:  Why are you all plaguing him so?  Is it the fate of"
the estate that is worrying you?  How many times have I seen this
estate in the hands of the court receiver!  Are men like women?
"Men are born spendthrifts and only know how to waste.  Look here,"
"child, count yourself fortunate that your husband is not wasting"
himself as well! 

My husband s list of charities was a long one.  He would assist
to the bitter end of utter failure anyone who wanted to invent a
new loom or rice-husking machine.  But what annoyed me most was
the way that Sandip Babu [9] used to fleece him on the pretext of
"  Swadeshi   work.  Whenever he wanted to start a newspaper,"
"or travel about preaching the Cause, or take a change of air by"
"the advice of his doctor, my husband would unquestioningly supply"
him with the money.  This was over and above the regular living
allowance which Sandip Babu also received from him.  The
strangest part of it was that my husband and Sandip Babu did not
agree in their opinions.

"As soon as the   Swadeshi   storm reached my blood, I said to"
my husband:  I must burn all my foreign clothes. 

 Why burn them?   said he.   You need not wear them as long as
you please. 

 As long as I please!  Not in this life ... 

" Very well, do not wear them for the rest of your life, then."
But why this bonfire business? 

 Would you thwart me in my resolve? 

 What I want to say is this: Why not try to build up something?
You should not waste even a tenth part of your energies in this
destructive excitement. 

 Such excitement will give us the energy to build. 

" That is as much as to say, that you cannot light the house"
unless you set fire to it. 

Then there came another trouble.  When Miss Gilby first came to
"our house there was a great flutter, which afterwards calmed down"
when they got used to her.  Now the whole thing was stirred up
afresh.  I had never bothered myself before as to whether Miss
"Gilby was European or Indian, but I began to do so now.  I said"
to my husband:  We must get rid of Miss Gilby. 

He kept silent.

"I talked to him wildly, and he went away sad at heart."

"After a fit of weeping, I felt in a more reasonable mood when we"
"met at night.   I cannot,  my husband said,  look upon Miss Gilby"
"through a mist of abstraction, just because she is English."
Cannot you get over the barrier of her name after such a long
acquaintance?  Cannot you realize that she loves you? 

I felt a little ashamed and replied with some sharpness:  Let her
remain.  I am not over anxious to send her away.   And Miss Gilby
remained.

But one day I was told that she had been insulted by a young
fellow on her way to church.  This was a boy whom we were
supporting.  My husband turned him out of the house.  There was
"not a single soul, that day, who could forgive my husband for"
that act--not even I.  This time Miss Gilby left of her own
"accord.  She shed tears when she came to say good-bye, but my"
mood would not melt.  To slander the poor boy so--and such a fine
"boy, too, who would forget his daily bath and food in his"
enthusiasm for   Swadeshi  .

My husband escorted Miss Gilby to the railway station in his own
carriage.  I was sure he was going too far.  When exaggerated
"accounts of the incident gave rise to a public scandal, which"
"found its way to the newspapers, I felt he had been rightly"
served.

"I had often become anxious at my husband s doings, but had never"
before been ashamed; yet now I had to blush for him!  I did not
"know exactly, nor did I care, what wrong poor Noren might, or"
"might not, have done to Miss Gilby, but the idea of sitting in"
judgement on such a matter at such a time!  I should have refused
to damp the spirit which prompted young Noren to defy the
Englishwoman.  I could not but look upon it as a sign of
"cowardice in my husband, that he should fail to understand this"
simple thing.  And so I blushed for him.

And yet it was not that my husband refused to support
"  Swadeshi  , or was in any way against the Cause.  Only he"
had not been able whole-heartedly to accept the spirit of
  Bande Mataram  .  [10]

" I am willing,  he said,  to serve my country; but my worship I"
reserve for Right which is far greater than my country.  To
worship my country as a god is to bring a curse upon it.

Chapter Two

Bimala s Story

IV



THIS was the time when Sandip Babu with his followers came to our
neighbourhood to preach   Swadeshi  .

There is to be a big meeting in our temple pavilion.  We women
"are sitting there, on one side, behind a screen.  Triumphant"
shouts of   Bande Mataram   come nearer: and to them I am
thrilling through and through.  Suddenly a stream of barefooted
"youths in turbans, clad in ascetic ochre, rushes into the"
"quadrangle, like a silt-reddened freshet into a dry river-bed at"
the first burst of the rains.  The whole place is filled with an
"immense crowd, through which Sandip Babu is borne, seated in a"
big chair hoisted on the shoulders of ten or twelve of the
youths.

  Bande Mataram!  Bande Mataram!  Bande Mataram  !  It seems
as though the skies would be rent and scattered into a thousand
fragments.

I had seen Sandip Babu s photograph before.  There was something
in his features which I did not quite like.  Not that he was bad-
"looking--far from it: he had a splendidly handsome face.  Yet, I"
"know not why, it seemed to me, in spite of all its brilliance,"
that too much of base alloy had gone into its making.  The light
in his eyes somehow did not shine true.  That was why I did not
like it when my husband unquestioningly gave in to all his
demands.  I could bear the waste of money; but it vexed me to
"think that he was imposing on my husband, taking advantage of"
"friendship.  His bearing was not that of an ascetic, nor even of"
"a person of moderate means, but foppish all over.  Love of"
comfort seemed to ...  any number of such reflections come back
"to me today, but let them be."

"When, however, Sandip Babu began to speak that afternoon, and the"
"hearts of the crowd swayed and surged to his words, as though"
"they would break all bounds, I saw him wonderfully transformed."
Especially when his features were suddenly lit up by a shaft of
"light from the slowly setting sun, as it sunk below the roof-line"
"of the pavilion, he seemed to me to be marked out by the gods as"
their messenger to mortal men and women.

"From beginning to end of his speech, each one of his utterances"
was a stormy outburst.  There was no limit to the confidence of
"his assurance.  I do not know how it happened, but I found I had"
impatiently pushed away the screen from before me and had fixed
my gaze upon him.  Yet there was none in that crowd who paid any
"heed to my doings.  Only once, I noticed, his eyes, like stars in"
"fateful Orion, flashed full on my face."

I was utterly unconscious of myself.  I was no longer the lady of
"the Rajah s house, but the sole representative of Bengal s"
womanhood.  And he was the champion of Bengal.  As the sky had
"shed its light over him, so he must receive the consecration of a"
woman s benediction ...

"It seemed clear to me that, since he had caught sight of me, the"
fire in his words had flamed up more fiercely.  Indra s [11]
"steed refused to be reined in, and there came the roar of thunder"
and the flash of lightning.  I said within myself that his
language had caught fire from my eyes; for we women are not only
"the deities of the household fire, but the flame of the soul"
itself.

I returned home that evening radiant with a new pride and joy.
The storm within me had shifted my whole being from one centre to
"another.  Like the Greek maidens of old, I fain would cut off my"
"long, resplendent tresses to make a bowstring for my hero.  Had"
"my outward ornaments been connected with my inner feelings, then"
"my necklet, my armlets, my bracelets, would all have burst their"
bonds and flung themselves over that assembly like a shower of
"meteors.  Only some personal sacrifice, I felt, could help me to"
bear the tumult of my exaltation.

"When my husband came home later, I was trembling lest he should"
utter a sound out of tune with the triumphant paean which was
"still ringing in my ears, lest his fanaticism for truth should"
lead him to express disapproval of anything that had been said
that afternoon.  For then I should have openly defied and
humiliated him.  But he did not say a word ...  which I did not
like either.

He should have said:  Sandip has brought me to my senses.  I now
realize how mistaken I have been all this time. 

"I somehow felt that he was spitefully silent, that he obstinately"
refused to be enthusiastic.  I asked how long Sandip Babu was
going to be with us.

" He is off to Rangpur early tomorrow morning,  said my husband."

 Must it be tomorrow? 

" Yes, he is already engaged to speak there. "

I was silent for a while and then asked again:  Could he not
possibly stay a day longer? 

" That may hardly be possible, but why? "

 I want to invite him to dinner and attend on him myself. 

My husband was surprised.  He had often entreated me to be
"present when he had particular friends to dinner, but I had never"
"let myself be persuaded.  He gazed at me curiously, in silence,"
with a look I did not quite understand.

"I was suddenly overcome with a sense of shame.   No, no,  I"
"exclaimed,  that would never do! "

" Why not!   said he.   I will ask him myself, and if it is at all"
possible he will surely stay on for tomorrow. 

It turned out to be quite possible.

I will tell the exact truth.  That day I reproached my Creator
because he had not made me surpassingly beautiful--not to steal
"any heart away, but because beauty is glory.  In this great day"
the men of the country should realize its goddess in its
"womanhood.  But, alas, the eyes of men fail to discern the"
"goddess, if outward beauty be lacking.  Would Sandip Babu find"
the   Shakti   of the Motherland manifest in me?  Or would he
"simply take me to be an ordinary, domestic woman?"

That morning I scented my flowing hair and tied it in a loose
"knot, bound by a cunningly intertwined red silk ribbon.  Dinner,"
"you see, was to be served at midday, and there was no time to dry"
my hair after my bath and do it up plaited in the ordinary way.
"I put on a gold-bordered white   sari  , and my short-sleeve"
muslin jacket was also gold-bordered.

I felt that there was a certain restraint about my costume and
"that nothing could well have been simpler.  But my sister-in-law,"
"who happened to be passing by, stopped dead before me, surveyed"
me from head to foot and with compressed lips smiled a meaning
"smile.  When I asked her the reason,  I am admiring your get-up! "
she said.

" What is there so entertaining about it?   I enquired,"
considerably annoyed.

" It s superb,  she said.   I was only thinking that one of those"
low-necked English bodices would have made it perfect.   Not only
"her mouth and eyes, but her whole body seemed to ripple with"
suppressed laughter as she left the room.

"I was very, very angry, and wanted to change everything and put"
on my everyday clothes.  But I cannot tell exactly why I could
not carry out my impulse.  Women are the ornaments of society--
"thus I reasoned with myself--and my husband would never like it,"
if I appeared before Sandip Babu unworthily clad.

My idea had been to make my appearance after they had sat down to
dinner.  In the bustle of looking after the serving the first
awkwardness would have passed off.  But dinner was not ready in
"time, and it was getting late.  Meanwhile my husband had sent for"
me to introduce the guest.

I was feeling horribly shy about looking Sandip Babu in the face.
"However, I managed to recover myself enough to say:  I am so"
sorry dinner is getting late. 

He boldly came and sat right beside me as he replied:  I get a
"dinner of some kind every day, but the Goddess of Plenty keeps"
"behind the scenes.  Now that the goddess herself has appeared, it"
matters little if the dinner lags behind. 

He was just as emphatic in his manners as he was in his public
speaking.  He had no hesitation and seemed to be accustomed to
"occupy, unchallenged, his chosen seat.  He claimed the right to"
"intimacy so confidently, that the blame would seem to belong to"
those who should dispute it.

"I was in terror lest Sandip Babu should take me for a shrinking,"
"old-fashioned bundle of inanity.  But, for the life of me, I"
could not sparkle in repartees such as might charm or dazzle him.
"What could have possessed me, I angrily wondered, to appear"
before him in such an absurd way?

"I was about to retire when dinner was over, but Sandip Babu, as"
"bold as ever, placed himself in my way."

" You must not,  he said,  think me greedy.  It was not the dinner"
"that kept me staying on, it was your invitation.  If you were to"
"run away now, that would not be playing fair with your guest. "

"If he had not said these words with a careless ease, they would"
"have been out of tune.  But, after all, he was such a great"
friend of my husband that I was like his sister.

"While I was struggling to climb up this high wave of intimacy, my"
"husband came to the rescue, saying:  Why not come back to us"
after you have taken your dinner? 

" But you must give your word,  said Sandip Babu,  before we let"
you off. 

" I will come,  said I, with a slight smile."

" Let me tell you,  continued Sandip Babu,  why I cannot trust"
"you.  Nikhil has been married these nine years, and all this"
while you have eluded me.  If you do this again for another nine
"years, we shall never meet again. "

I took up the spirit of his remark as I dropped my voice to
reply:  Why even then should we not meet? 

 My horoscope tells me I am to die early.  None of my forefathers
have survived their thirtieth year.  I am now twenty-seven. 

He knew this would go home.  This time there must have been a
shade of concern in my low voice as I said:  The blessings of the
whole country are sure to avert the evil influence of the stars. 

 Then the blessings of the country must be voiced by its goddess.
"This is the reason for my anxiety that you should return, so that"
my talisman may begin to work from today. 

Sandip Babu had such a way of taking things by storm that I got
no opportunity of resenting what I never should have permitted in
another.

" So,  he concluded with a laugh,  I am going to hold this husband"
of yours as a hostage till you come back. 

"As I was coming away, he exclaimed:  May I trouble you for a"
trifle? 

I started and turned round.

" Don t be alarmed,  he said.   It s merely a glass of water.  You"
might have noticed that I did not drink any water with my dinner.
I take it a little later. 

Upon this I had to make a show of interest and ask him the
reason.  He began to give the history of his dyspepsia.  I was
"told how he had been a martyr to it for seven months, and how,"
"after the usual course of nuisances, which included different"
"allopathic and homoeopathic misadventures, he had obtained the"
most wonderful results by indigenous methods.

" Do you know,  he added, with a smile,  God has built even my"
infirmities in such a manner that they yield only under the
bombardment of   Swadeshi   pills. 

"My husband, at this, broke his silence.   You must confess,  said"
"he,  that you have as immense an attraction for foreign medicine"
as the earth has for meteors.  You have three shelves in your
sitting-room full of... 

Sandip Babu broke in:  Do you know what they are?  They are the
"punitive police.  They come, not because they are wanted, but"
"because they are imposed on us by the rule of this modern age,"
exacting fines and-inflicting injuries. 

"My husband could not bear exaggerations, and I could see he"
disliked this.  But all ornaments are exaggerations.  They are
"not made by God, but by man.  Once I remember in defence of some"
untruth of mine I said to my husband:  Only the trees and beasts
"and birds tell unmitigated truths, because these poor things have"
not the power to invent.  In this men show their superiority to
"the lower creatures, and women beat even men.  Neither is a"
"profusion of ornament unbecoming for a woman, nor a profusion of"
untruth. 

As I came out into the passage leading to the zenana I found my
"sister-in-law, standing near a window overlooking the reception"
"rooms, peeping through the venetian shutter."

 You here?   I asked in surprise.

 Eavesdropping!   she replied.

"When I returned, Sandip Babu was tenderly apologetic.   I am"
"afraid we have spoilt your appetite,  he said."

"I felt greatly ashamed.  Indeed, I had been too indecently quick"
"over my dinner.  With a little calculation, it would become quite"
evident that my non-eating had surpassed the eating.  But I had
no idea that anyone could have been deliberately calculating.

"I suppose Sandip Babu detected my feeling of shame, which only"
"augmented it.   I was sure,  he said,  that you had the impulse"
"of the wild deer to run away, but it is a great boon that you"
took the trouble to keep your promise with me. 

"I could not think of any suitable reply and so I sat down,"
"blushing and uncomfortable, at one end of the sofa.  The vision"
"that I had of myself, as the   Shakti   of Womanhood,"
"incarnate, crowning Sandip Babu simply with my presence, majestic"
"and unashamed, failed me altogether."

Sandip Babu deliberately started a discussion with my husband.
He knew that his keen wit flashed to the best effect in an
"argument.  I have often since observed, that he never lost an"
opportunity for a passage at arms whenever I happened to be
present.

He was familiar with my husband s views on the cult of   Bande
"Mataram  , and began in a provoking way:  So you do not allow"
that there is room for an appeal to the imagination in patriotic
work? 

" It has its place, Sandip, I admit, but I do not believe in"
giving it the whole place.  I would know my country in its frank
"reality, and for this I am both afraid and ashamed to make use of"
hypnotic texts of patriotism. 

 What you call hypnotic texts I call truth.  I truly believe my
country to be my God.  I worship Humanity.  God manifests Himself
both in man and in his country. 

" If that is what you really believe, there should be no"
"difference for you between man and man, and so between country"
and country. 

" Quite true.  But my powers are limited, so my worship of"
Humanity is continued in the worship of my country. 

" I have nothing against your worship as such, but how is it you"
propose to conduct your worship of God by hating other countries
in which He is equally manifest? 

 Hate is also an adjunct of worship.  Arjuna won Mahadeva s
"favour by wrestling with him.  God will be with us in the end, if"
we are prepared to give Him battle. 

" If that be so, then those who are serving and those who are"
"harming the country are both His devotees.  Why, then, trouble to"
preach patriotism? 

" In the case of one s own country, it is different.  There the"
heart clearly demands worship. 

 If you push the same argument further you can say that since God
"is manifested in us, our   self   has to be worshipped before"
all else; because our natural instinct claims it. 

" Look here, Nikhil, this is all merely dry logic.  Can t you"
recognize that there is such a thing as feeling? 

" I tell you the truth, Sandip,  my husband replied.   It is my"
"feelings that are outraged, whenever you try to pass off"
"injustice as a duty, and unrighteousness as a moral ideal.  The"
"fact, that I am incapable of stealing, is not due to my"
"possessing logical faculties, but to my having some feeling of"
respect for myself and love for ideals. 

I was raging inwardly.  At last I could keep silent no longer.
" Is not the history of every country,  I cried,  whether England,"
"France, Germany, or Russia, the history of stealing for the sake"
of one s own country? 

 They have to answer for these thefts; they are doing so even
now; their history is not yet ended. 

" At any rate,  interposed Sandip Babu,  why should we not follow"
suit?  Let us first fill our country s coffers with stolen goods
"and then take centuries, like these other countries, to answer"
"for them, if we must.  But, I ask you, where do you find this"
answering  in history? 

 When Rome was answering for her sin no one knew it.  All that
"time, there was apparently no limit to her prosperity.  But do"
you not see one thing: how these political bags of theirs are
"bursting with lies and treacheries, breaking their backs under"
their weight? 

Never before had I had any opportunity of being present at a
discussion between my husband and his men friends.  Whenever he
argued with me I could feel his reluctance to push me into a
corner.  This arose out of the very love he bore me.  Today for
the first time I saw his fencer s skill in debate.

"Nevertheless, my heart refused to accept my husband s position."
"I was struggling to find some answer, but it would not come."
"When the word  righteousness  comes into an argument, it sounds"
ugly to say that a thing can be too good to be useful.

All of a sudden Sandip Babu turned to me with the question:  What
do   you   say to this? 

" I do not care about fine distinctions,  I broke out.   I will"
tell you broadly what I feel.  I am only human.  I am covetous.
"I would have good things for my country.  If I am obliged, I"
would snatch them and filch them.  I have anger.  I would be
"angry for my country s sake.  If necessary, I would smite and"
"slay to avenge her insults.  I have my desire to be fascinated,"
and fascination must be supplied to me in bodily shape by my
country.  She must have some visible symbol casting its spell
"upon my mind.  I would make my country a Person, and call her"
"Mother, Goddess, Durga--for whom I would redden the earth with"
"sacrificial offerings.  I am human, not divine. "

Sandip Babu leapt to his feet with uplifted arms and shouted
 Hurrah! --The next moment he corrected himself and cried:
   Bande Mataram  . 

A shadow of pain passed over the face of my husband.  He said to
me in a very gentle voice:  Neither am I divine: I am human.  And
therefore I dare not permit the evil which is in me to be
"exaggerated into an image of my country--never, never! "

"Sandip Babu cried out:  See, Nikhil, how in the heart of a woman"
Truth takes flesh and blood.  Woman knows how to be cruel: her
virulence is like a blind storm.  It is beautifully fearful.  In
"man it is ugly, because it harbours in its centre the gnawing"
"worms of reason and thought.  I tell you, Nikhil, it is our women"
who will save the country.  This is not the time for nice
"scruples.  We must be unswervingly, unreasoningly brutal.  We"
must sin.  We must give our women red sandal paste with which to
anoint and enthrone our sin.  Don t you remember what the poet
says:

/*
"  Come, Sin, O beautiful Sin,"
  Let thy stinging red kisses pour down fiery red wine into our
    blood.
  Sound the trumpet of imperious evil
"  And cross our forehead with the wreath of exulting lawlessness,"
"  O Deity of Desecration,"
"  Smear our breasts with the blackest mud of disrepute,"
    unashamed.
*/

"Down with that righteousness, which cannot smilingly bring rack"
and ruin. 

"When Sandip Babu, standing with his head high, insulted at a"
"moment s impulse all that men have cherished as their highest, in"
"all countries and in all times, a shiver went right through my"
body.

"But, with a stamp of his foot, he continued his declamation:  I"
"can see that you are that beautiful spirit of fire, which burns"
the home to ashes and lights up the larger world with its flame.
Give to us the indomitable courage to go to the bottom of Ruin
itself.  Impart grace to all that is baneful. 

It was not clear to whom Sandip Babu addressed his last appeal.
It might have been She whom he worshipped with his   Bande
Mataram  .  It might have been the Womanhood of his country.
"Or it might have been its representative, the woman before him."
"He would have gone further in the same strain, but my husband"
suddenly rose from his seat and touched him lightly on the
"shoulder saying:  Sandip, Chandranath Babu is here. "

"I started and turned round, to find an aged gentleman at the"
"door, calm and dignified, in doubt as to whether he should come"
in or retire.  His face was touched with a gentle light like that
of the setting sun.

"My husband came up to me and whispered:  This is my master, of"
whom I have so often told you.  Make your obeisance to him. 

I bent reverently and took the dust of his feet.  He gave me his
"blessing saying:  May God protect you always, my little mother. "
I was sorely in need of such a blessing at that moment.



Nikhil s Story

I



One day I had the faith to believe that I should be able to bear
whatever came from my God.  I never had the trial.  Now I think
it has come.

I used to test my strength of mind by imagining all kinds of evil
"which might happen to me--poverty, imprisonment, dishonour,"
death--even Bimala s.  And when I said to myself that I should be
"able to receive these with firmness, I am sure I did not"
"exaggerate.  Only I could never even imagine one thing, and today"
"it is that of which I am thinking, and wondering whether I can"
"really bear it.  There is a thorn somewhere pricking in my heart,"
constantly giving me pain while I am about my daily work.  It
seems to persist even when I am asleep.  The very moment I wake
"up in the morning, I find that the bloom has gone from the face"
of the sky.  What is it?  What has happened?

"My mind has become so sensitive, that even my past life, which"
"came to me in the disguise of happiness, seems to wring my very"
heart with its falsehood; and the shame and sorrow which are
"coming close to me are losing their cover of privacy, all the"
more because they try to veil their faces.  My heart has become
"all eyes.  The things that should not be seen, the things I do"
not want to see--these I must see.

The day has come at last when my ill-starred life has to reveal
its destitution in a long-drawn series of exposures.  This
"penury, all unexpected, has taken its seat in the heart where"
plenitude seemed to reign.  The fees which I paid to delusion for
just nine years of my youth have now to be returned with interest
to Truth till the end of my days.

What is the use of straining to keep up my pride?  What harm if I
confess that I have something lacking in me?  Possibly it is that
unreasoning forcefulness which women love to find in men.  But is
strength mere display of muscularity?  Must strength have no
scruples in treading the weak underfoot?

But why all these arguments?  Worthiness cannot be earned merely
"by disputing about it.  And I am unworthy, unworthy, unworthy."

"What if I am unworthy?  The true value of love is this, that it"
can ever bless the unworthy with its own prodigality.  For the
"worthy there are many rewards on God s earth, but God has"
specially reserved love for the unworthy.

"Up till now Bimala was my home-made Bimala, the product of the"
confined space and the daily routine of small duties.  Did the
"love which I received from her, I asked myself, come from the"
"deep spring of her heart, or was it merely like the daily"
provision of pipe water pumped up by the municipal steam-engine
of society?

I longed to find Bimala blossoming fully in all her truth and
"power.  But the thing I forgot to calculate was, that one must"
"give up all claims based on conventional rights, if one would"
find a person freely revealed in truth.

Why did I fail to think of this?  Was it because of the husband s
pride of possession over his wife?  No.  It was because I placed
the fullest trust upon love.  I was vain enough to think that I
had the power in me to bear the sight of truth in its awful
"nakedness.  It was tempting Providence, but still I clung to my"
proud determination to come out victorious in the trial.

Bimala had failed to understand me in one thing.  She could not
fully realize that I held as weakness all imposition of force.
Only the weak dare not be just.  They shirk their responsibility
of fairness and try quickly to get at results through the short-
cuts of injustice.  Bimala has no patience with patience.  She
"loves to find in men the turbulent, the angry, the unjust.  Her"
respect must have its element of fear.

I had hoped that when Bimala found herself free in the outer
world she would be rescued from her infatuation for tyranny.  But
now I feel sure that this infatuation is deep down in her nature.
Her love is for the boisterous.  From the tip of her tongue to
the pit of her stomach she must tingle with red pepper in order
"to enjoy the simple fare of life.  But my determination was,"
"never to do my duty with frantic impetuosity, helped on by the"
fiery liquor of excitement.  I know Bimala finds it difficult to
"respect me for this, taking my scruples for feebleness--and she"
is quite angry with me because I am not running amuck crying
  Bande Mataram  .

"For the matter of that, I have become unpopular with all my"
countrymen because I have not joined them in their carousals.
"They are certain that either I have a longing for some title, or"
else that I am afraid of the police.  The police on their side
suspect me of harbouring some hidden design and protesting too
much in my mildness.

"What I really feel is this, that those who cannot find food for"
their enthusiasm in a knowledge of their country as it actually
"is, or those who cannot love men just because they are men--who"
needs must shout and deify their country in order to keep up
their excitement--these love excitement more than their country.

To try to give our infatuation a higher place than Truth is a
sign of inherent slavishness.  Where our minds are free we find
ourselves lost.  Our moribund vitality must have for its rider
"either some fantasy, or someone in authority, or a sanction from"
"the pundits, in order to make it move.  So long as we are"
impervious to truth and have to be moved by some hypnotic
"stimulus, we must know that we lack the capacity for self-"
"government.  Whatever may be our condition, we shall either need"
some imaginary ghost or some actual medicine-man to terrorize
over us.

"The other day when Sandip accused me of lack of imagination,"
saying that this prevented me from realizing my country in a
"visible image, Bimala agreed with him.  I did not say anything in"
"my defence, because to win in argument does not lead to"
happiness.  Her difference of opinion is not due to any
"inequality of intelligence, but rather to dissimilarity of"
nature.

"They accuse me of being unimaginative--that is, according to"
"them, I may have oil in my lamp, but no flame.  Now this is"
exactly the accusation which I bring against them.  I would say
"to them:  You are dark, even as the flints are.  You must come to"
violent conflicts and make a noise in order to produce your
"sparks.  But their disconnected flashes merely assist your pride,"
and not your clear vision. 

I have been noticing for some time that there is a gross cupidity
about Sandip.  His fleshly feelings make him harbour delusions
about his religion and impel him into a tyrannical attitude in
"his patriotism.  His intellect is keen, but his nature is coarse,"
and so he glorifies his selfish lusts under high-sounding names.
The cheap consolations of hatred are as urgently necessary for
him as the satisfaction of his appetites.  Bimala has often
"warned me, in the old days, of his hankering after money.  I"
"understood this, but I could not bring myself to haggle with"
Sandip.  I felt ashamed even to own to myself that he was trying
to take advantage of me.

"It will, however, be difficult to explain to Bimala today that"
Sandip s love of country is but a different phase of his covetous
self-love.  Bimala s hero-worship of Sandip makes me hesitate all
"the more to talk to her about him, lest some touch of jealousy"
may lead me unwittingly into exaggeration.  It may be that the
pain at my heart is already making me see a distorted picture of
Sandip.  And yet it is better perhaps to speak out than to keep
my feelings gnawing within me.

II



"I have known my master these thirty years.  Neither calumny, nor"
"disaster, nor death itself has any terrors for him.  Nothing"
"could have saved me, born as I was into the traditions of this"
"family of ours, but that he has established his own life in the"
"centre of mine, with its peace and truth and spiritual vision,"
thus making it possible for me to realize goodness in its truth.

My master came to me that day and said:  Is it necessary to
detain Sandip here any longer? 

His nature was so sensitive to all omens of evil that he had at
"once understood.  He was not easily moved, but that day he felt"
the dark shadow of trouble ahead.  Do I not know how well he
loves me?

At tea-time I said to Sandip:  I have just had a letter from
Rangpur.  They are complaining that I am selfishly detaining you.
When will you be going there? 

Bimala was pouring out the tea.  Her face fell at once.  She
threw just one enquiring glance at Sandip.

" I have been thinking,  said Sandip,  that this wandering up and"
down means a tremendous waste of energy.  I feel that if I could
work from a centre I could achieve more permanent results. 

With this he looked up at Bimala and asked:  Do you not think so
too? 

Bimala hesitated for a reply and then said:  Both ways seem good
#NAME?
That in which you find greater satisfaction is the way for you. 

" Then let me speak out my mind,  said Sandip.   I have never yet"
found any one source of inspiration suffice me for good.  That is
"why I have been constantly moving about, rousing enthusiasm in"
"the people, from which in turn I draw my own store of energy."
Today you have given me the message of my country.  Such fire I
have never beheld in any man.  I shall be able to spread the fire
"of enthusiasm in my country by borrowing it from you.  No, do not"
be ashamed.  You are far above all modesty and diffidence.  You
"are the Queen Bee of our hive, and we the workers shall rally"
"around you.  You shall be our centre, our inspiration. "

Bimala flushed all over with bashful pride and her hand shook as
she went on pouring out the tea.

Another day my master came to me and said:  Why don t you two go
up to Darjeeling for a change?  You are not looking well.  Have
you been getting enough sleep? 

I asked Bimala in the evening whether she would care to have a
trip to the Hills.  I knew she had a great longing to see the
"Himalayas.  But she refused ...  The country s Cause, I suppose!"

I must not lose my faith: I shall wait.  The passage from the
narrow to the larger world is stormy.  When she is familiar with
"this freedom, then I shall know where my place is.  If I discover"
"that I do not fit in with the arrangement of the outer world,"
"then I shall not quarrel with my fate, but silently take my leave"
...  Use force?  But for what?  Can force prevail against Truth?



Sandip s Story

I



The impotent man says:  That which has come to my share is mine. 
And the weak man assents.  But the lesson of the whole world is:
 That is really mine which I can snatch away.   My country does
not become mine simply because it is the country of my birth.  It
becomes mine on the day when I am able to win it by force.

"Every man has a natural right to possess, and therefore greed is"
natural.  It is not in the wisdom of nature that we should be
"content to be deprived.  What my mind covets, my surroundings"
must supply.  This is the only true understanding between our
inner and outer nature in this world.  Let moral ideals remain
merely for those poor anaemic creatures of starved desire whose
grasp is weak.  Those who can desire with all their soul and
"enjoy with all their heart, those who have no hesitation or"
"scruple, it is they who are the anointed of Providence.  Nature"
spreads out her riches and loveliest treasures for their benefit.
"They swim across streams, leap over walls, kick open doors, to"
help themselves to whatever is worth taking.  In such a getting
one can rejoice; such wresting as this gives value to the thing
taken.

"Nature surrenders herself, but only to the robber.  For she"
"delights in this forceful desire, this forceful abduction.  And"
"so she does not put the garland of her acceptance round the lean,"
scraggy neck of the ascetic.  The music of the wedding march is
struck.  The time of the wedding I must not let pass.  My heart
"therefore is eager.  For, who is the bridegroom?  It is I.  The"
"bridegroom s place belongs to him who, torch in hand, can come in"
time.  The bridegroom in Nature s wedding hall comes unexpected
and uninvited.

"Ashamed?  No, I am never ashamed!  I ask for whatever I want, and"
I do not always wait to ask before I take it.  Those who are
deprived by their own diffidence dignify their privation by the
name of modesty.  The world into which we are born is the world
of reality.  When a man goes away from the market of real things
"with empty hands and empty stomach, merely filling his bag with"
"big sounding words, I wonder why he ever came into this hard"
world at all.  Did these men get their appointment from the
"epicures of the religious world, to play set tunes on sweet,"
pious texts in that pleasure garden where blossom airy nothings?
I neither affect those tunes nor do I find any sustenance in
those blossoms.

"What I desire, I desire positively, superlatively.  I want to"
knead it with both my hands and both my feet; I want to smear it
all over my body; I want to gorge myself with it to the full.
The scrannel pipes of those who have worn themselves out by their
"moral fastings, till they have become flat and pale like starved"
"vermin infesting a long-deserted bed, will never reach my ear."

"I would conceal nothing, because that would be cowardly.  But if"
"I cannot bring myself to conceal when concealment is needful,"
"that also is cowardly.  Because you have your greed, you build"
"your walls.  Because I have my greed, I break through them.  You"
use your power: I use my craft.  These are the realities of life.
On these depend kingdoms and empires and all the great
enterprises of men.

As for those   avatars   who come down from their paradise to
talk to us in some holy jargon--their words are not real.
"Therefore, in spite of all the applause they get, these sayings"
of theirs only find a place in the hiding corners of the weak.

"They are despised by those who are strong, the rulers of the"
world.  Those who have had the courage to see this have won
"success, while those poor wretches who are dragged one way by"
"nature and the other way by these ava tars, they set one foot in"
"the boat of the real and the other in the boat of the unreal, and"
"thus are in a pitiable plight, able neither to advance nor to"
keep their place.

There are many men who seem to have been born only with an
"obsession to die.  Possibly there is a beauty, like that of a"
"sunset, in this lingering death in life which seems to fascinate"
"them.  Nikhil lives this kind of life, if life it may be called."
"Years ago, I had a great argument with him on this point."

" It is true,  he said,  that you cannot get anything except by"
"force.  But then what is this force?  And then also, what is this"
getting?  The strength I believe in is the strength of
renouncing. 

" So you,  I exclaimed,  are infatuated with the glory of"
bankruptcy. 

 Just as desperately as the chick is infatuated about the
"bankruptcy of its shell,  he replied.   The shell is real enough,"
yet it is given up in exchange for intangible light and air.  A
"sorry exchange, I suppose you would call it? "

"When once Nikhil gets on to metaphor, there is no hope of making"
"him see that he is merely dealing with words, not with realities."
"Well, well, let him be happy with his metaphors.  We are the"
flesh-eaters of the world; we have teeth and nails; we pursue and
grab and tear.  We are not satisfied with chewing in the evening
"the cud of the grass we have eaten in the morning.  Anyhow, we"
cannot allow your metaphor-mongers to bar the door to our
"sustenance.  In that case we shall simply steal or rob, for we"
must live.

People will say that I am starting some novel theory just because
those who are moving in this world are in the habit of talking
differently though they are really acting up to it all the time.
"Therefore they fail to understand, as I do, that this is the only"
"working moral principle.  In point of fact, I know that my idea"
"is not an empty theory at all, for it has been proved in"
practical life.  I have found that my way always wins over the
"hearts of women, who are creatures of this world of reality and"
"do not roam about in cloud-land, as men do, in idea-filled"
balloons.

"Women find in my features, my manner, my gait, my speech, a"
masterful passion--not a passion dried thin with the heat of
"asceticism, not a passion with its face turned back at every step"
"in doubt and debate, but a full-blooded passion.  It roars and"
"rolls on, like a flood, with the cry:  I want, I want, I want. "
"Women feel, in their own heart of hearts, that this indomitable"
"passion is the lifeblood of the world, acknowledging no law but"
"itself, and therefore victorious.  For this reason they have so"
often abandoned themselves to be swept away on the flood-tide of
"my passion, recking naught as to whether it takes them to life or"
to death.  This power which wins these women is the power of
"mighty men, the power which wins the world of reality."

Those who imagine the greater desirability of another world
merely shift their desires from the earth to the skies.  It
"remains to be seen how high their gushing fountain will play, and"
for how long.  But this much is certain: women were not created
for these pale creatures--these lotus-eaters of idealism.

" Affinity!   When it suited my need, I have often said that God"
"has created special pairs of men and women, and that the union of"
"such is the only legitimate union, higher than all unions made by"
"law.  The reason of it is, that though man wants to follow"
"nature, he can find no pleasure in it unless he screens himself"
with some phrase--and that is why this world is so overflowing
with lies.

 Affinity!   Why should there be only one?  There may be affinity
with thousands.  It was never in my agreement with nature that I
should overlook all my innumerable affinities for the sake of
"only one.  I have discovered many in my own life up to now, yet"
that has not closed the door to one more--and that one is clearly
visible to my eyes.  She has also discovered her own affinity to
me.

And then?

"Then, if I do not win I am a coward."



Chapter Three

Bimala s Story

VI



I WONDER what could have happened to my feeling of shame.  The
"fact is, I had no time to think about myself.  My days and nights"
"were passing in a whirl, like an eddy with myself in the centre."
No gap was left for hesitation or delicacy to enter.

One day my sister-in-law remarked to my husband:  Up to now the
women of this house have been kept weeping.  Here comes the men s
turn.

" We must see that they do not miss it,  she continued, turning to"
"me.   I see you are out for the fray, Chota [12] Rani!  Hurl your"
shafts straight at their hearts. 

Her keen eyes looked me up and down.  Not one of the colours into
"which my toilet, my dress, my manners, my speech, had blossomed"
"out had escaped her.  I am ashamed to speak of it today, but I"
felt no shame then.  Something within me was at work of which I
"was not even conscious.  I used to overdress, it is true, but"
"more like an automaton, with no particular design.  No doubt I"
knew which effort of mine would prove specially pleasing to
"Sandip Babu, but that required no intuition, for he would discuss"
it openly before all of them.

"One day he said to my husband:  Do you know, Nikhil, when I first"
"saw our Queen Bee, she was sitting there so demurely in her gold-"
bordered   sari  .  Her eyes were gazing inquiringly into
"space, like stars which had lost their way, just as if she had"
"been for ages standing on the edge of some darkness, looking out"
"for something unknown.  But when I saw her, I felt a quiver run"
through me.  It seemed to me that the gold border of her
  sari   was her own inner fire flaming out and twining round
"her.  That is the flame we want, visible fire!  Look here, Queen"
"Bee, you really must do us the favour of dressing once more as a"
living flame. 

So long I had been like a small river at the border of a village.
My rhythm and my language were different from what they are now.
"But the tide came up from the sea, and my breast heaved; my banks"
gave way and the great drumbeats of the sea waves echoed in my
mad current.  I could not understand the meaning of that sound in
my blood.  Where was that former self of mine?  Whence came
foaming into me this surging flood of glory?  Sandip s hungry
eyes burnt like the lamps of worship before my shrine.  All his
gaze proclaimed that I was a wonder in beauty and power; and the
"loudness of his praise, spoken and unspoken, drowned all other"
"voices in my world.  Had the Creator created me afresh, I"
wondered?  Did he wish to make up now for neglecting me so long?
I who before was plain had become suddenly beautiful.  I who
before had been of no account now felt in myself all the
splendour of Bengal itself.

For Sandip Babu was not a mere individual.  In him was the
confluence of millions of minds of the country.  When he called
"me the Queen Bee of the hive, I was acclaimed with a chorus of"
"praise by all our patriot workers.  After that, the loud jests of"
my sister-in-law could not touch me any longer.  My relations
with all the world underwent a change.  Sandip Babu made it clear
how all the country was in need of me.  I had no difficulty in
"believing this at the time, for I felt that I had the power to do"
everything.  Divine strength had come to me.  It was something
"which I had never felt before, which was beyond myself.  I had no"
time to question it to find out what was its nature.  It seemed
"to belong to me, and yet to transcend me.  It comprehended the"
whole of Bengal.

Sandip Babu would consult me about every little thing touching
"the Cause.  At first I felt very awkward and would hang back, but"
that soon wore off.  Whatever I suggested seemed to astonish him.
He would go into raptures and say:  Men can only think.  You
women have a way of understanding without thinking.  Woman was
"created out of God s own fancy.  Man, He had to hammer into"
shape. 

Letters used to come to Sandip Babu from all parts of the country
which were submitted to me for my opinion.  Occasionally he
disagreed with me.  But I would not argue with him.  Then after a
day or two--as if a new light had suddenly dawned upon him--he
would send for me and say:  It was my mistake.  Your suggestion
was the correct one.   He would often confess to me that wherever
he had taken steps contrary to my advice he had gone wrong.  Thus
I gradually came to be convinced that behind whatever was taking
"place was Sandip Babu, and behind Sandip Babu was the plain"
common sense of a woman.  The glory of a great responsibility
filled my being.

My husband had no place in our counsels.  Sandip Babu treated him
"as a younger brother, of whom personally one may be very fond and"
yet have no use for his business advice.  He would tenderly and
"smilingly talk about my husband s childlike innocence, saying"
that his curious doctrine and perversities of mind had a flavour
of humour which made them all the more lovable.  It was seemingly
this very affection for Nikhil which led Sandip Babu to forbear
from troubling him with the burden of the country.

"Nature has many anodynes in her pharmacy, which she secretly"
"administers when vital relations are being insidiously severed,"
"so that none may know of the operation, till at last one awakes"
to know what a great rent has been made.  When the knife was busy
"with my life s most intimate tie, my mind was so clouded with"
fumes of intoxicating gas that I was not in the least aware of
what a cruel thing was happening.  Possibly this is woman s
nature.  When her passion is roused she loses her sensibility for
"all that is outside it.  When, like the river, we women keep to"
"our banks, we give nourishment with all that we have: when we"
overflow them we destroy with all that we are.

Junior Rani.



Sandip s Story

II



I can see that something has gone wrong.  I got an inkling of it
the other day.

"Ever since my arrival, Nikhil s sitting-room had become a thing"
"amphibious--half women s apartment, half men s: Bimala had access"
"to it from the zenana, it was not barred to me from the outer"
"side.  If we had only gone slow, and made use of our privileges"
"with some restraint, we might not have fallen foul of other"
people.  But we went ahead so vehemently that we could not think
of the consequences.

"Whenever Bee comes into Nikhil s room, I somehow get to know of"
it from mine.  There are the tinkle of bangles and other little
sounds; the door is perhaps shut with a shade of unnecessary
vehemence; the bookcase is a trifle stiff and creaks if jerked
"open.  When I enter I find Bee, with her back to the door, ever"
so busy selecting a book from the shelves.  And as I offer to
assist her in this difficult task she starts and protests; and
then we naturally get on to other topics.

"The other day, on an inauspicious [13] Thursday afternoon, I"
sallied forth from my room at the call of these same sounds.
There was a man on guard in the passage.  I walked on without so
"much as glancing at him, but as I approached the door he put"
"himself in my way saying:  Not that way, sir. "

 Not that way!  Why? 

 The Rani Mother is there. 

" Oh, very well.  Tell your Rani Mother that Sandip Babu wants to"
see her. 

" That cannot be, sir.  It is against orders. "

I felt highly indignant.   I order you!   I said in a raised
voice.

 Go and announce me. 

The fellow was somewhat taken aback at my attitude.  In the
meantime I had neared the door.  I was on the point of reaching
"it, when he followed after me and took me by the arm saying:  No,"
"sir, you must not. "

What!  To be touched by a flunkey!  I snatched away my arm and
gave the man a sounding blow.  At this moment Bee came out of the
room to find the man about to insult me.

I shall never forget the picture of her wrath!  That Bee is
beautiful is a discovery of my own.  Most of our people would see
"nothing in her.  Her tall, slim figure these boors would call"
 lanky .  But it is just this lithesomeness of hers that I
"admire--like an up-leaping fountain of life, coming direct out of"
"the depths of the Creator s heart.  Her complexion is dark, but"
"it is the lustrous darkness of a sword-blade, keen and"
scintillating.

" Nanku!   she commanded, as she stood in the doorway, pointing"
"with her finger,  leave us. "

" Do not be angry with him,  said I.   If it is against orders, it"
is I who should retire. 

Bee s voice was still trembling as she replied:  You must not go.
Come in. 

"It was not a request, but again a command!  I followed her in,"
and taking a chair fanned myself with a fan which was on the
table.  Bee scribbled something with a pencil on a sheet of paper
"and, summoning a servant, handed it to him saying:  Take this to"
the Maharaja. 

" Forgive me,  I resumed.   I was unable to control myself, and"
hit that man of yours.

" You served him right,  said Bee."

" But it was not the poor fellow s fault, after all.  He was only"
obeying his orders. 

"Here Nikhil came in, and as he did so I left my seat with a rapid"
movement and went and stood near the window with my back to the
room.

" Nanku, the guard, has insulted Sandip Babu,  said Bee to Nikhil."

Nikhil seemed to be so genuinely surprised that I had to turn
round and stare at him.  Even an outrageously good man fails in
keeping up his pride of truthfulness before his wife--if she be
the proper kind of woman.

 He insolently stood in the way when Sandip Babu was coming in
"here,  continued Bee.   He said he had orders ... "

 Whose orders?   asked Nikhil.

" How am I to know?   exclaimed Bee impatiently, her eyes brimming"
over with mortification.

Nikhil sent for the man and questioned him.   It was not my
"fault,  Nanku repeated sullenly.   I had my orders. "

 Who gave you the order? 

 The Bara Rani Mother. 

"We were all silent for a while.  After the man had left, Bee"
said:  Nanku must go! 

Nikhil remained silent.  I could see that his sense of justice
would not allow this.  There was no end to his qualms.  But this
time he was up against a tough problem.  Bee was not the woman to
take things lying down.  She would have to get even with her
sister-in-law by punishing this fellow.  And as Nikhil remained
"silent, her eyes flashed fire.  She knew not how to pour her"
scorn upon her husband s feebleness of spirit.  Nikhil left the
room after a while without another word.

"The next day Nanku was not to be seen.  On inquiry, I learnt that"
"he had been sent off to some other part of the estates, and that"
his wages had not suffered by such transfer.

I could catch glimpses of the ravages of the storm raging over
"this, behind the scenes.  All I can say is, that Nikhil is a"
"curious creature, quite out of the common."

"The upshot was, that after this Bee began to send for me to the"
"sitting-room, for a chat, without any contrivance, or pretence of"
its being an accident.  Thus from bare suggestion we came to
broad hint: the implied came to be expressed.  The daughter-in-
law of a princely house lives in a starry region so remote from
the ordinary outsider that there is not even a regular road for
"his approach.  What a triumphal progress of Truth was this which,"
"gradually but persistently, thrust aside veil after veil of"
"obscuring custom, till at length Nature herself was laid bare."

Truth?  Of course it was the truth!  The attraction of man and
"woman for each other is fundamental.  The whole world of matter,"
"from the speck of dust upwards, is ranged on its side.  And yet"
"men would keep it hidden away out of sight, behind a tissue of"
words; and with home-made sanctions and prohibitions make of it a
"domestic utensil.  Why, it s as absurd as melting down the solar"
system to make a watch-chain for one s son-in-law!  [14]

"When, in spite of all, reality awakes at the call of what is but"
"naked truth, what a gnashing of teeth and beating of breasts is"
there!  But can one carry on a quarrel with a storm?  It never
"takes the trouble to reply, it only gives a shaking."

"I am enjoying the sight of this truth, as it gradually reveals"
"itself.  These tremblings of steps, these turnings of the face,"
are sweet to me: and sweet are the deceptions which deceive not
"only others, but also Bee herself.  When Reality has to meet the"
"unreal, deception is its principal weapon; for its enemies always"
"try to shame Reality by calling it gross, and so it needs must"
"hide itself, or else put on some disguise.  The circumstances are"
"such that it dare not frankly avow:  Yes, I am gross, because I"
"am true.  I am flesh.  I am passion.  I am hunger, unashamed and"
cruel. 

"All is now clear to me.  The curtain flaps, and through it I can"
"see the preparations for the catastrophe.  The little red ribbon,"
"which peeps through the luxuriant masses of her hair, with its"
"flush of secret longing, it is the lolling tongue of the red"
"storm cloud.  I feel the warmth of each turn of her   sari  ,"
"each suggestion of her raiment, of which even the wearer may not"
be fully conscious.

"Bee was not conscious, because she was ashamed of the reality; to"
"which men have given a bad name, calling it Satan; and so it has"
"to steal into the garden of paradise in the guise of a snake, and"
whisper secrets into the ears of man s chosen consort and make
her rebellious; then farewell to all ease; and after that comes
death!

My poor little Queen Bee is living in a dream.  She knows not
which way she is treading.  It would not be safe to awaken her
before the time.  It is best for me to pretend to be equally
unconscious.

"The other day, at dinner, she was gazing at me in a curious sort"
"of way, little realizing what such glances mean!  As my eyes met"
"hers, she turned away with a flush.   You are surprised at my"
"appetite,  I remarked.   I can hide everything, except that I am"
"greedy!  Anyhow, why trouble to blush for me, since I am"
shameless? 

"This only made her colour more furiously, as she stammered:  No,"
"no, I was only... "

" I know,  I interrupted.   Women have a weakness for greedy men;"
for it is this greed of ours which gives them the upper hand.
The indulgence which I have always received at their hands has
made me all the more shameless.  I do not mind your watching the
"good things disappear, not one bit.  I mean to enjoy every one of"
them. 

The other day I was reading an English book in which sex-problems
were treated in an audaciously realistic manner.  I had left it
"lying in the sitting-room.  As I went there the next afternoon,"
"for something or other, I found Bee seated with this book in her"
hand.  When she heard my footsteps she hurriedly put it down and
placed another book over it--a volume of Mrs Hemans s poems.

" I have never been able to make out,  I began,  why women are so"
"shy about being caught reading poetry.  We men--lawyers,"
"mechanics, or what not--may well feel ashamed.  If we must read"
"poetry, it should be at dead of night, within closed doors.  But"
you women are so akin to poesy.  The Creator Himself is a lyric
"poet, and Jayadeva [15] must have practised the divine art seated"
at His feet. 

"Bee made no reply, but only blushed uncomfortably.  She made as"
"if she would leave the room.  Whereupon I protested:  No, no,"
"pray read on.  I will just take a book I left here, and run"
away.   With which I took up my book from the table.   Lucky you
"did not think of glancing over its pages,  I continued,  or you"
would have wanted to chastise me. 

 Indeed!  Why?   asked Bee.

" Because it is not poetry,  said I.   Only blunt things, bluntly"
"put, without any finicking niceness.  I wish Nikhil would read"
it. 

Bee frowned a little as she murmured:  What makes you wish that? 

" He is a man, you see, one of us.  My only quarrel with him is"
that he delights in a misty vision of this world.  Have you not
observed how this trait of his makes him look on   Swadeshi  
as if it was some poem of which the metre must be kept correct at
"every step?  We, with the clubs of our prose, are the iconoclasts"
of metre. 

 What has your book to do with   Swadeshi  ? 

 You would know if you only read it.  Nikhil wants to go by made-
"up maxims, in   Swadeshi   as in everything else; so he knocks"
"up against human nature at every turn, and then falls to abusing"
it.  He never will realize that human nature was created long
"before phrases were, and will survive them too. "

Bee was silent for a while and then gravely said:  Is it not a
part of human nature to try and rise superior to itself? 

"I smiled inwardly.   These are not your words , I thought to"
myself.   You have learnt them from Nikhil.  You are a healthy
human being.  Your flesh and blood have responded to the call of
reality.  You are burning in every vein with life-fire--do I not
know it?  How long should they keep you cool with the wet towel
of moral precepts? 

" The weak are in the majority,  I said aloud.   They are"
continually poisoning the ears of men by repeating these
shibboleths.  Nature has denied them strength--it is thus that
they try to enfeeble others. 

" We women are weak,  replied Bimala.   So I suppose we must join"
in the conspiracy of the weak. 

 Women weak!   I exclaimed with a laugh.   Men belaud you as
"delicate and fragile, so as to delude you into thinking"
yourselves weak.  But it is you women who are strong.  Men make a
"great outward show of their so-called freedom, but those who know"
their inner minds are aware of their bondage.  They have
manufactured scriptures with their own hands to bind themselves;
with their very idealism they have made golden fetters of women
to wind round their body and mind.  If men had not that
extraordinary faculty of entangling themselves in meshes of their
"own contriving, nothing could have kept them bound.  But as for"
"you women, you have desired to conceive reality with body and"
soul.  You have given birth to reality.  You have suckled reality
at your breasts. 

"Bee was well read for a woman, and would not easily give in to my"
"arguments.   If that were true,  she objected,  men would not"
have found women attractive. 

" Women realize the danger,  I replied.   They know that men love"
"delusions, so they give them full measure by borrowing their own"
"phrases.  They know that man, the drunkard, values intoxication"
"more than food, and so they try to pass themselves off as an"
"intoxicant.  As a matter of fact, but for the sake of man, woman"
has no need for any make-believe. 

" Why, then, are you troubling to destroy the illusion? "

 For freedom.  I want the country to be free.  I want human
relations to be free.

I was aware that it is unsafe suddenly to awake a sleep-walker.
"But I am so impetuous by nature, a halting gait does not suit me."
I knew I was overbold that day.  I knew that the first shock of
such ideas is apt to be almost intolerable.  But with women it is
always audacity that wins.

"Just as we were getting on nicely, who should walk in but"
Nikhil s old tutor Chandranath Babu.  The world would have been
"not half a bad place to live in but for these schoolmasters, who"
make one want to quit in disgust.  The Nikhil type wants to keep
the world always a school.  This incarnation of a school turned
up that afternoon at the psychological moment.

"We all remain schoolboys in some corner of our hearts, and I,"
"even I, felt somewhat pulled up.  As for poor Bee, she at once"
"took her place solemnly, like the topmost girl of the class on"
the front bench.  All of a sudden she seemed to remember that she
had to face her examination.

Some people are so like eternal pointsmen lying in wait by the
"line, to shunt one s train of thought from one rail to another."

Chandranath Babu had no sooner come in than he cast about for
"some excuse to retire, mumbling:  I beg your pardon, I... "

"Before he could finish, Bee went up to him and made a profound"
"obeisance, saying:  Pray do not leave us, sir.  Will you not take"
a seat?   She looked like a drowning person clutching at him for
support--the little coward!

But possibly I was mistaken.  It is quite likely that there was a
"touch of womanly wile in it.  She wanted, perhaps, to raise her"
value in my eyes.  She might have been pointedly saying to me:
 Please don t imagine for a moment that I am entirely overcome by
you.  My respect for Chandranath Babu is even greater. 

"Well, indulge in your respect by all means!  Schoolmasters thrive"
"on it.  But not being one of them, I have no use for that empty"
compliment.

Chandranath Babu began to talk about   Swadeshi  .  I thought
I would let him go on with his monologues.  There is nothing like
letting an old man talk himself out.  It makes him feel that he
"is winding up the world, forgetting all the while how far away"
the real world is from his wagging tongue.

But even my worst enemy would not accuse me of patience.  And
when Chandranath Babu went on to say:  If we expect to gather
"fruit where we have sown no seed, then we ...   I had to"
interrupt him.

 Who wants fruit?   I cried.   We go by the Author of the Gita
"who says that we are concerned only with the doing, not with the"
fruit of our deeds. 

 What is it then that you do want?   asked Chandranath Babu.

" Thorns!   I exclaimed,  which cost nothing to plant. "

" Thorns do not obstruct others only,  he replied.   They have a"
way of hurting one s own feet. 

" That is all right for a copy-book,  I retorted.   But the real"
thing is that we have this burning at heart.  Now we have only to
cultivate thorns for other s soles; afterwards when they hurt us
we shall find leisure to repent.  But why be frightened even of
that?  When at last we have to die it will be time enough to get
cold.  While we are on fire let us seethe and boil. 

"Chandranath Babu smiled.   Seethe by all means,  he said,  but do"
"not mistake it for work, or heroism.  Nations which have got on"
"in the world have done so by action, not by ebullition.  Those"
"who have always lain in dread of work, when with a start they"
"awake to their sorry plight, they look to short-cuts and scamping"
for their deliverance. 

"I was girding up my loins to deliver a crushing reply, when"
"Nikhil came back.  Chandranath Babu rose, and looking towards"
"Bee, said:  Let me go now, my little mother, I have some work to"
attend to. 

"As he left, I showed Nikhil the book in my hand.   I was telling"
"Queen Bee about this book,  I said."

"Ninety-nine per cent of people have to be deluded with lies, but"
it is easier to delude this perpetual pupil of the schoolmaster
"with the truth.  He is best cheated openly.  So, in playing with"
"him, the simplest course was to lay my cards on the table."

"Nikhil read the title on the cover, but said nothing.   These"
"writers,  I continued,  are busy with their brooms, sweeping away"
the dust of epithets with which men have covered up this world of
"ours.  So, as I was saying, I wish you would read it. "

" I have read it,  said Nikhil."

" Well, what do you say? "

" It is all very well for those who really care to think, but"
poison for those who shirk thought. 

 What do you mean? 

 Those who preach  Equal Rights of Property  should not be
"thieves.  For, if they are, they would be preaching lies.  When"
"passion is in the ascendant, this kind of book is not rightly"
understood. 

" Passion,  I replied,  is the street lamp which guides us.  To"
call it untrue is as hopeless as to expect to see better by
plucking out our natural eyes. 

Nikhil was visibly growing excited.   I accept the truth of
"passion,  he said,  only when I recognize the truth of restraint."
By pressing what we want to see right into our eyes we only
"injure them: we do not see.  So does the violence of passion,"
"which would leave no space between the mind and its object,"
defeat its purpose. 

" It is simply your intellectual foppery,  I replied,  which makes"
"you indulge in moral delicacy, ignoring the savage side of truth."
"This merely helps you to mystify things, and so you fail to do"
your work with any degree of strength. 

" The intrusion of strength,  said Nikhil impatiently,  where"
"strength is out of place, does not help you in your work ...  But"
why are we arguing about these things?  Vain arguments only brush
off the fresh bloom of truth. 

"I wanted Bee to join in the discussion, but she had not said a"
"word up to now.  Could I have given her too rude a shock, leaving"
her assailed with doubts and wanting to learn her lesson afresh
"from the schoolmaster?  Still, a thorough shaking-up is"
essential.  One must begin by realizing that things supposed to
be unshakeable can be shaken.

" I am glad I had this talk with you,  I said to Nikhil,  for I"
was on the point of lending this book to Queen Bee to read. 

" What harm?   said Nikhil.   If I could read the book, why not"
"Bimala too?  All I want to say is, that in Europe people look at"
everything from the viewpoint of science.  But man is neither
"mere physiology, nor biology, nor psychology, nor even sociology."
For God s sake don t forget that.  Man is infinitely more than
"the natural science of himself.  You laugh at me, calling me the"
"schoolmaster s pupil, but that is what you are, not I.  You want"
"to find the truth of man from your science teachers, and not from"
your own inner being. 

 But why all this excitement?   I mocked.

 Because I see you are bent on insulting man and making him
petty. 

 Where on earth do you see all that? 

" In the air, in my outraged feelings.  You would go on wounding"
"the great, the unselfish, the beautiful in man. "

 What mad idea is this of yours? 

"Nikhil suddenly stood up.   I tell you plainly, Sandip,  he said,"
" man may be wounded unto death, but he will not die.  This is the"
"reason why I am ready to suffer all, knowing all, with eyes"
open. 

With these words he hurriedly left the room.

"I was staring blankly at his retreating figure, when the sound of"
"a book, falling from the table, made me turn to find Bee"
"following him with quick, nervous steps, making a detour to avoid"
passing too near me.

"A curious creature, that Nikhil!  He feels the danger threatening"
"his home, and yet why does he not turn me out?  I know, he is"
waiting for Bimal to give him the cue.  If Bimal tells him that
"their mating has been a misfit, he will bow his head and admit"
that it may have been a blunder!  He has not the strength of mind
to understand that to acknowledge a mistake is the greatest of
all mistakes.  He is a typical example of how ideas make for
weakness.  I have not seen another like him--so whimsical a
product of nature!  He would hardly do as a character in a novel
"or drama, to say nothing of real life."

And Bee?  I am afraid her dream-life is over from today.  She has
at length understood the nature of the current which is bearing
"her along.  Now she must either advance or retreat, open-eyed."
"The chances are she will now advance a step, and then retreat a"
"step.  But that does not disturb me.  When one is on fire, this"
rushing to and fro makes the blaze all the fiercer.  The fright
she has got will only fan her passion.

"Perhaps I had better not say much to her, but simply select some"
modern books for her to read.  Let her gradually come to the
conviction that to acknowledge and respect passion as the supreme
"reality, is to be modern--not to be ashamed of it, not to glorify"
"restraint.  If she finds shelter in some such word as  modern ,"
she will find strength.

"Be that as it may, I must see this out to the end of the Fifth"
"Act.  I cannot, unfortunately, boast of being merely a spectator,"
"seated in the royal box, applauding now and again.  There is a"
"wrench at my heart, a pang in every nerve.  When I have put out"
"the light and am in my bed, little touches, little glances,"
little words flit about and fill the darkness.  When I get up in
"the morning, I thrill with lively anticipations, my blood seems"
to course through me to the strains of music ...

There was a double photo-frame on the table with Bee s photograph
by the side of Nikhil s.  I had taken out hers.  Yesterday I
showed Bee the empty side and said:  Theft becomes necessary only
"because of miserliness, so its sin must be divided between the"
miser and the thief.  Do you not think so? 

" It was not a good one,  observed Bee simply, with a little"
smile.

 What is to be done?   said I.   A portrait cannot be better than
"a portrait.  I must be content with it, such as it is. "

Bee took up a book and began to turn over the pages.   If you are
"annoyed,  I went on,  I must make a shift to fill up the"
vacancy. 

Today I have filled it up.  This photograph of mine was taken in
"my early youth.  My face was then fresher, and so was my mind."
Then I still cherished some illusions about this world and the
"next.  Faith deceives men, but it has one great merit: it imparts"
a radiance to the features.

"My portrait now reposes next to Nikhil s, for are not the two of"
us old friends?

Nikhil s Story

I WAS never self-conscious.  But nowadays I often try to take an
outside view--to see myself as Bimal sees me.  What a dismally
"solemn picture it makes, my habit of taking things too seriously!"

"Better, surely, to laugh away the world than flood it with tears."
"That is, in fact, how the world gets on.  We relish our food and"
"rest, only because we can dismiss, as so many empty shadows, the"
"sorrows scattered everywhere, both in the home and in the outer"
"world.  If we took them as true, even for a moment, where would"
"be our appetite, our sleep?"

"But I cannot dismiss myself as one of these shadows, and so the"
load of my sorrow lies eternally heavy on the heart of my world.

"Why not stand out aloof in the highway of the universe, and feel"
"yourself to be part of the all?  In the midst of the immense,"
"age-long concourse of humanity, what is Bimal to you?  Your wife?"
What is a wife?  A bubble of a name blown big with your own
"breath, so carefully guarded night and day, yet ready to burst at"
any pin-prick from outside.

"My wife--and so, forsooth, my very own!  If she says:  No, I am"
myself --am I to reply:  How can that be?  Are you not mine? 

" My wife --Does that amount to an argument, much less the truth?"
Can one imprison a whole personality within that name?

My wife!--Have I not cherished in this little world all that is
"purest and sweetest in my life, never for a moment letting it"
"down from my bosom to the dust?  What incense of worship, what"
"music of passion, what flowers of my spring and of my autumn,"
"have I not offered up at its shrine?  If, like a toy paper-boat,"
she be swept along into the muddy waters of the gutter--would I
not also...  ?

"There it is again, my incorrigible solemnity!  Why  muddy ?  What"
" gutter  names, called in a fit of jealousy, do not change the"
"facts of the world.  If Bimal is not mine, she is not; and no"
"fuming, or fretting, or arguing will serve to prove that she is."
If my heart is breaking--let it break!  That will not make the
world bankrupt--nor even me; for man is so much greater than the
things he loses in this life.  The very ocean of tears has its
"other shore, else none would have ever wept."

But then there is Society to be considered ...  which let Society
"consider!  If I weep it is for myself, not for Society.  If Bimal"
"should say she is not mine, what care I where my Society wife may"
be?

"Suffering there must be; but I must save myself, by any means in"
"my power, from one form of self-torture: I must never think that"
my life loses its value because of any neglect it may suffer.
The full value of my life does not all go to buy my narrow
domestic world; its great commerce does not stand or fall with
some petty success or failure in the bartering of my personal
joys and sorrows.

The time has come when I must divest Bimala of all the ideal
decorations with which I decked her.  It was owing to my own
weakness that I indulged in such idolatry.  I was too greedy.  I
"created an angel of Bimala, in order to exaggerate my own"
enjoyment.  But Bimala is what she is.  It is preposterous to
expect that she should assume the rle of an angel for my
pleasure.  The Creator is under no obligation to supply me with
"angels, just because I have an avidity for imaginary perfection."

I must acknowledge that I have merely been an accident in
"Bimala s life.  Her nature, perhaps, can only find true union"
"with one like Sandip.  At the same time, I must not, in false"
"modesty, accept my rejection as my desert.  Sandip certainly has"
"attractive qualities, which had their sway also upon myself; but"
"yet, I feel sure, he is not a greater man than I.  If the wreath"
"of victory falls to his lot today, and I am overlooked, then the"
dispenser of the wreath will be called to judgement.

I say this in no spirit of boasting.  Sheer necessity has driven
"me to the pass, that to secure myself from utter desolation I"
"must recognize all the value that I truly possess.  Therefore,"
"through the, terrible experience of suffering let there come upon"
me the joy of deliverance--deliverance from self-distrust.

I have come to distinguish what is really in me from what I
foolishly imagined to be there.  The profit and loss account has
"been settled, and that which remains is myself--not a crippled"
"self, dressed in rags and tatters, not a sick self to be nursed"
"on invalid diet, but a spirit which has gone through the worst,"
and has survived.

My master passed through my room a moment ago and said with his
"hand on my shoulder.   Get away to bed, Nikhil, the night is far"
advanced. 

"The fact is, it has become so difficult for me to go to bed till"
"late--till Bimal is fast asleep.  In the day-time we meet, and"
"even converse, but what am I to say when we are alone together,"
in the silence of the night?--so ashamed do I feel in mind and
body.

" How is it, sir, you have not yet retired?   I asked in my turn."
"My master smiled a little, as he left me, saying:  My sleeping"
days are over.  I have now attained the waking age. 

"I had written thus far, and was about to rise to go off bedwards"
"when, through the window before me, I saw the heavy pall of July"
"cloud suddenly part a little, and a big star shine through.  It"
"seemed to say to me:  Dreamland ties are made, and dreamland ties"
"are broken, but I am here for ever--the everlasting lamp of the"
bridal night. 

All at once my heart was full with the thought that my Eternal
"Love was steadfastly waiting for me through the ages, behind the"
"veil of material things.  Through many a life, in many a mirror,"
"have I seen her image--broken mirrors, crooked mirrors, dusty"
"mirrors.  Whenever I have sought to make the mirror my very own,"
"and shut it up within my box, I have lost sight of the image."
"But what of that.  What have I to do with the mirror, or even the"
image?

"My beloved, your smile shall never fade, and every dawn there"
shall appear fresh for me the vermilion mark on your forehead!

" What childish cajolery of self-deception,  mocks some devil from"
his dark corner-- silly prattle to make children quiet! 

"That may be.  But millions and millions of children, with their"
"million cries, have to be kept quiet.  Can it be that all this"
"multitude is quieted with only a lie?  No, my Eternal Love cannot"
"deceive me, for she is true!"

She is true; that is why I have seen her and shall see her so
"often, even in my mistakes, even through the thickest mist of"
tears.  I have seen her and lost her in the crowd of life s
"market-place, and found her again; and I shall find her once more"
when I have escaped through the loophole of death.

"Ah, cruel one, play with me no longer!  If I have failed to track"
"you by the marks of your footsteps on the way, by the scent of"
"your tresses lingering in the air, make me not weep for that for"
ever.  The unveiled star tells me not to fear.  That which is
eternal must always be there.

Now let me go and see my Bimala.  She must have spread her tired
"limbs on the bed, limp after her struggles, and be asleep.  I"
will leave a kiss on her forehead without waking her--that shall
be the flower-offering of my worship.  I believe I could forget
"everything after death--all my mistakes, all my sufferings--but"
some vibration of the memory of that kiss would remain; for the
wreath which is being woven out of the kisses of many a
successive birth is to crown the Eternal Beloved.

"As the gong of the watch rang out, sounding the hour of two, my"
"sister-in-law came into the room.   Whatever are you doing,"
brother dear?   [16] she cried.   For pity s sake go to bed and
stop worrying so.  I cannot bear to look on that awful shadow of
pain on your face.   Tears welled up in her eyes and overflowed
as she entreated me thus.

"I could not utter a word, but took the dust of her feet, as I"
went off to bed.

Bimala s Story

"At first I suspected nothing, feared nothing; I simply felt"
dedicated to my country.  What a stupendous joy there was in this
"unquestioning surrender.  Verily had I realized how, in"
"thoroughness of self-destruction, man can find supreme bliss."

"For aught I know, this frenzy of mine might have come to a"
"gradual, natural end.  But Sandip Babu would not have it so, he"
would insist on revealing himself.  The tone of his voice became
"as intimate as a touch, every look flung itself on its knees in"
"beggary.  And, through it all, there burned a passion which in"
"its violence made as though it would tear me up by the roots, and"
drag me along by the hair.

I will not shirk the truth.  This cataclysmal desire drew me by
day and by night.  It seemed desperately alluring--this making
"havoc of myself.  What a shame it seemed, how terrible, and yet"
"how sweet!  Then there was my overpowering curiosity, to which"
"there seemed no limit.  He of whom I knew but little, who never"
"could assuredly be mine, whose youth flared so vigorously in a"
"hundred points of flame--oh, the mystery of his seething"
"passions, so immense, so tumultuous!"

"I began with a feeling of worship, but that soon passed away.  I"
"ceased even to respect Sandip; on the contrary, I began to look"
"down upon him.  Nevertheless this flesh-and-blood lute of mine,"
"fashioned with my feeling and fancy, found in him a master-"
"player.  What though I shrank from his touch, and even came to"
loathe the lute itself; its music was conjured up all the same.

I must confess there was something in me which ...  what shall I
say?  ...  which makes me wish I could have died!

"Chandranath Babu, when he finds leisure, comes to me.  He has the"
power to lift my mind up to an eminence from where I can see in a
moment the boundary of my life extended on all sides and so
"realize that the lines, which I took from my bounds, were merely"
imaginary.

But what is the use of it all?  Do I really desire emancipation?
Let suffering come to our house; let the best in me shrivel up
and become black; but let this infatuation not leave me--such
seems to be my prayer.

"When, before my marriage, I used to see a brother-in-law of mine,"
"now dead, mad with drink--beating his wife in his frenzy, and"
"then sobbing and howling in maudlin repentance, vowing never to"
"touch liquor again, and yet, the very same evening, sitting down"
to drink and drink--it would fill me with disgust.  But my
intoxication today is still more fearful.  The stuff has not to
"be procured or poured out: it springs within my veins, and I know"
not how to resist it.

Must this continue to the end of my days?  Now and again I start
"and look upon myself, and think my life to be a nightmare which"
will vanish all of a sudden with all its untruth.  It has become
so frightfully incongruous.  It has no connection with its past.
"What it is, how it could have come to this pass, I cannot"
understand.

One day my sister-in-law remarked with a cutting laugh:  What a
wonderfully hospitable Chota Rani we have!  Her guest absolutely
"will not budge.  In our time there used to be guests, too; but"
they had not such lavish looking after--we were so absurdly taken
up with our husbands.  Poor brother Nikhil is paying the penalty
of being born too modern.  He should have come as a guest if he
wanted to stay on.  Now it looks as if it were time for him to
"quit ...  O you little demon, do your glances never fall, by"
"chance, on his agonized face? "

This sarcasm did not touch me; for I knew that these women had it
not in them to understand the nature of the cause of my devotion.
I was then wrapped in the protecting armour of the exaltation of
"sacrifice, through which such shafts were powerless to reach and"
shame me.

VIII



For some time all talk of the country s cause has been dropped.
"Our conversation nowadays has become full of modern sex-problems,"
"and various other matters, with a sprinkling of poetry, both old"
"Vaishnava and modern English, accompanied by a running undertone"
"of melody, low down in the bass, such as I have never in my life"
"heard before, which seems to me to sound the true manly note, the"
note of power.

The day had come when all cover was gone.  There was no longer
"even the pretence of a reason why Sandip Babu should linger on,"
or why I should have confidential talks with him every now and
"then.  I felt thoroughly vexed with myself, with my sister-in-"
"law, with the ways of the world, and I vowed I would never again"
"go to the outer apartments, not if I were to die for it."

"For two whole days I did not stir out.  Then, for the first time,"
I discovered how far I had travelled.  My life felt utterly
tasteless.  Whatever I touched I wanted to thrust away.  I felt
myself waiting--from the crown of my head to the tips of my toes
"--waiting for something, somebody; my blood kept tingling with"
some expectation.

I tried busying myself with extra work.  The bedroom floor was
clean enough but I insisted on its being scrubbed over again
under my eyes.  Things were arranged in the cabinets in one kind
of order; I pulled them all out and rearranged them in a
different way.  I found no time that afternoon even to do up my
"hair; I hurriedly tied it into a loose knot, and went and worried"
"everybody, fussing about the store-room.  The stores seemed"
"short, and pilfering must have been going on of late, but I could"
not muster up the courage to take any particular person to task--
for might not the thought have crossed somebody s mind:  Where
were your eyes all these days! 

"In short, I behaved that day as one possessed.  The next day I"
"tried to do some reading.  What I read I have no idea, but after"
"a spell of absentmindedness I found I had wandered away, book in"
"hand, along the passage leading towards the outer apartments, and"
was standing by a window looking out upon the verandah running
along the row of rooms on the opposite side of the quadrangle.
"One of these rooms, I felt, had crossed over to another shore,"
and the ferry had ceased to ply.  I felt like the ghost of myself
"of two days ago, doomed to remain where I was, and yet not really"
"there, blankly looking out for ever."

"As I stood there, I saw Sandip come out of his room into the"
"verandah, a newspaper in his hand.  I could see that he looked"
"extraordinarily disturbed.  The courtyard, the railings, in"
"front, seemed to rouse his wrath.  He flung away his newspaper"
with a gesture which seemed to want to rend the space before him.

I felt I could no longer keep my vow.  I was about to move on
"towards the sitting-room, when I found my sister-in-law behind"
"me.   O Lord, this beats everything!   she ejaculated, as she"
glided away.  I could not proceed to the outer apartments.

"The next morning when my maid came calling,  Rani Mother, it is"
"getting late for giving out the stores,  I flung the keys to her,"
"saying,  Tell Harimati to see to it,  and went on with some"
"embroidery of English pattern on which I was engaged, seated near"
the window.

"Then came a servant with a letter.   From Sandip Babu,  said he."
What unbounded boldness!  What must the messenger have thought?
There was a tremor within my breast as I opened the envelope.
"There was no address on the letter, only the words:   An urgent"
matter--touching the Cause.  Sandip  .

"I flung aside the embroidery.  I was up on my feet in a moment,"
giving a touch or two to my hair by the mirror.  I kept the
"  sari   I had on, changing only my jacket--for one of my"
jackets had its associations.

"I had to pass through one of the verandahs, where my sister-in-"
law used to sit in the morning slicing betel-nut.  I refused to
"feel awkward.   Whither away, Chota Rani?   she cried."

 To the sitting-room outside. 

" So early!  A matine, eh? "

"And, as I passed on without further reply, she hummed after me a"
flippant song.

IX



"When I was about to enter the sitting-room, I saw Sandip immersed"
"in an illustrated catalogue of British Academy pictures, with his"
back to the door.  He has a great notion of himself as an expert
in matters of Art.

One day my husband said to him:  If the artists ever want a
"teacher, they need never lack for one so long as you are there. "
"It had not been my husband s habit to speak cuttingly, but"
latterly there has been a change and he never spares Sandip.

 What makes you suppose that artists need no teachers?   Sandip
retorted.

" Art is a creation,  my husband replied.   So we should humbly be"
content to receive our lessons about Art from the work of the
artist. 

"Sandip laughed at this modesty, saying:  You think that meekness"
is a kind of capital which increases your wealth the more you use
it.  It is my conviction that those who lack pride only float
about like water reeds which have no roots in the soil. 

My mind used to be full of contradictions when they talked thus.
On the one hand I was eager that my husband should win in
"argument and that Sandip s pride should be shamed.  Yet, on the"
"other, it was Sandip s unabashed pride which attracted me so.  It"
"shone like a precious diamond, which knows no diffidence, and"
sparkles in the face of the sun itself.

I entered the room.  I knew Sandip could hear my footsteps as I
"went forward, but he pretended not to, and kept his eyes on the"
book.

"I dreaded his Art talks, for I could not overcome my delicacy"
"about the pictures he talked of, and the things he said, and had"
much ado in putting on an air of overdone insensibility to hide
"my qualms.  So, I was almost on the point of retracing my steps,"
"when, with a deep sigh, Sandip raised his eyes, and affected to"
"be startled at the sight of me.   Ah, you have come!   he said."

"In his words, in his tone, in his eyes, there was a world of"
"suppressed reproach, as if the claims he had acquired over me"
"made my absence, even for these two or three days, a grievous"
"wrong.  I knew this attitude was an insult to me, but, alas, I"
had not the power to resent it.

"I made no reply, but though I was looking another way, I could"
not help feeling that Sandip s plaintive gaze had planted itself
"right on my face, and would take no denial.  I did so wish he"
"would say something, so that I could shelter myself behind his"
"words.  I cannot tell how long this went on, but at last I could"
"stand it no longer.   What is this matter,  I asked,  you are"
wanting to tell me about? 

Sandip again affected surprise as he said:  Must there always be
"some matter?  Is friendship by itself a crime?  Oh, Queen Bee, to"
think that you should make so light of the greatest thing on
earth!  Is the heart s worship to be shut out like a stray cur? 

There was again that tremor within me.  I could feel the crisis
"coming, too importunate to be put off.  Joy and fear struggled"
"for the mastery.  Would my shoulders, I wondered, be broad enough"
"to stand its shock, or would it not leave me overthrown, with my"
face in the dust?

I was trembling all over.  Steadying myself with an effort I
"repeated:  You summoned me for something touching the Cause, so I"
have left my household duties to attend to it. 

" That is just what I was trying to explain,  he said, with a dry"
laugh.   Do you not know that I come to worship?  Have I not told
"you that, in you, I visualize the   Shakti   of our country?"
The Geography of a country is not the whole truth.  No one can
"give up his life for a map!  When I see you before me, then only"
do I realize how lovely my country is.  When you have anointed me
"with your own hands, then shall I know I have the sanction of my"
"country; and if, with that in my heart, I fall fighting, it shall"
"not be on the dust of some map-made land, but on a lovingly"
spread skirt--do you know what kind of skirt?--like that of the
"earthen-red   sari   you wore the other day, with a broad"
blood-red border.  Can I ever forget it?  Such are the visions
"which give vigour to life, and joy to death! "

"Sandip s eyes took fire as he went on, but whether it was the"
"fire of worship, or of passion, I could not tell.  I was reminded"
"of the day on which I first heard him speak, when I could not be"
"sure whether he was a person, or just a living flame."

I had not the power to utter a word.  You cannot take shelter
behind the walls of decorum when in a moment the fire leaps up
"and, with the flash of its sword and the roar of its laughter,"
destroys all the miser s stores.  I was in terror lest he should
forget himself and take me by the hand.  For he shook like a
quivering tongue of fire; his eyes showered scorching sparks on
me.

" Are you for ever determined,  he cried after a pause,  to make"
gods of your petty household duties--you who have it in you to
send us to life or to death?  Is this power of yours to be kept
"veiled in a zenana?  Cast away all false shame, I pray you; snap"
your fingers at the whispering around.  Take your plunge today
into the freedom of the outer world. 

"When, in Sandip s appeals, his worship of the country gets to be"
"subtly interwoven with his worship of me, then does my blood"
"dance, indeed, and the barriers of my hesitation totter.  His"
"talks about Art and Sex, his distinctions between Real and"
"Unreal, had but clogged my attempts at response with some"
"revolting nastiness.  This, however, now burst again into a glow"
before which my repugnance faded away.  I felt that my
resplendent womanhood made me indeed a goddess.  Why should not
its glory flash from my forehead with visible brilliance?  Why
"does not my voice find a word, some audible cry, which would be"
like a sacred spell to my country for its fire initiation?

"All of a sudden my maid Khema rushed into the room, dishevelled."
" Give me my wages and let me go,  she screamed.   Never in all my"
life have I been so ...   The rest of her speech was drowned in
sobs.

 What is the matter? 

"Thako, the Bara Rani s maid, it appeared, had for no rhyme or"
"reason reviled her in unmeasured terms.  She was in such a state,"
it was no manner of use trying to pacify her by saying I would
look into the matter afterwards.

The slime of domestic life that lay beneath the lotus bank of
womanhood came to the surface.  Rather than allow Sandip a
"prolonged vision of it, I had to hurry back within."



X


"My sister-in-law was absorbed in her betel-nuts, the suspicion of"
"a smile playing about her lips, as if nothing untoward had"
happened.  She was still humming the same song.

 Why has your Thako been calling poor Khema names?   I burst out.

 Indeed?  The wretch!  I will have her broomed out of the house.
"What a shame to spoil your morning out like this!  As for Khema,"
where are the hussy s manners to go and disturb you when you are
"engaged?  Anyhow, Chota Rani, don t you worry yourself with these"
"domestic squabbles.  Leave them to me, and return to your"
friend. 

How suddenly the wind in the sails of our mind veers round!  This
"going to meet Sandip outside seemed, in the light of the zenana"
"code, such an extraordinarily out-of-the-way thing to do that I"
"went off to my own room, at a loss for a reply.  I knew this was"
my sister-in-law s doing and that she had egged her maid on to
contrive this scene.  But I had brought myself to such an
unstable poise that I dared not have my fling.

"Why, it was only the other day that I found I could not keep up"
to the last the unbending hauteur with which I had demanded from
my husband the dismissal of the man Nanku.  I felt suddenly
abashed when the Bara Rani came up and said:  It is really all my
"fault, brother dear.  We are old-fashioned folk, and I did not"
"quite like the ways of your Sandip Babu, so I only told the guard"
...  but how was I to know that our Chota Rani would take this as
an insult?--I thought it would be the other way about!  Just my
incorrigible silliness! 

The thing which seems so glorious when viewed from the heights of
"the country s cause, looks so muddy when seen from the bottom."
"One begins by getting angry, and then feels disgusted."

"I shut myself into my room, sitting by the window, thinking how"
easy life would be if only one could keep in harmony with one s
surroundings.  How simply the senior Rani sits in her verandah
with her betel-nuts and how inaccessible to me has become my
"natural seat beside my daily duties!  Where will it all end, I"
"asked myself?  Shall I ever recover, as from a delirium, and"
forget it all; or am I to be dragged to depths from which there
can be no escape in this life?  How on earth did I manage to let
"my good fortune escape me, and spoil my life so?  Every wall of"
"this bedroom of mine, which I first entered nine years ago as a"
"bride, stares at me in dismay."

"When my husband came home, after his M.A.  examination, he"
brought for me this orchid belonging to some far-away land beyond
the seas.  From beneath these few little leaves sprang such a
"cascade of blossoms, it looked as if they were pouring forth from"
"some overturned urn of Beauty.  We decided, together, to hang it"
"here, over this window.  It flowered only that once, but we have"
always been in hope of its doing so once more.  Curiously enough
"I have kept on watering it these days, from force of habit, and"
it is still green.

It is now four years since I framed a photograph of my husband in
ivory and put it in the niche over there.  If I happen to look
that way I have to lower my eyes.  Up to last week I used
"regularly to put there the flowers of my worship, every morning"
after my bath.  My husband has often chided me over this.

 It shames me to see you place me on a height to which I do not
"belong,  he said one day."

 What nonsense! 

" I am not only ashamed, but also jealous! "

" Just hear him!  Jealous of whom, pray? "

" Of that false me.  It only shows that I am too petty for you,"
that you want some extraordinary man who can overpower you with
"his superiority, and so you needs must take refuge in making for"
yourself another  me . 

" This kind of talk only makes me angry,  said I."

 What is the use of being angry with me?   he replied.   Blame
"your fate which allowed you no choice, but made you take me"
blindfold.  This keeps you trying to retrieve its blunder by
making me out a paragon. 

I felt so hurt at the bare idea that tears started to my eyes
"that day.  And whenever I think of that now, I cannot raise my"
eyes to the niche.

For now there is another photograph in my jewel case.  The other
"day, when arranging the sitting-room, I brought away that double"
"photo frame, the one in which Sandip s portrait was next to my"
husband s.  To this portrait I have no flowers of worship to
"offer, but it remains hidden away under my gems.  It has all the"
greater fascination because kept secret.  I look at it now and
"then with doors closed.  At night I turn up the lamp, and sit"
"with it in my hand, gazing and gazing.  And every night I think"
"of burning it in the flame of the lamp, to be done with it for"
ever; but every night I heave a sigh and smother it again in my
pearls and diamonds.

"Ah, wretched woman!  What a wealth of love was twined round each"
"one of those jewels!  Oh, why am I not dead?"

Sandip had impressed it on me that hesitation is not in the
"nature of woman.  For her, neither right nor left has any"
existence--she only moves forward.  When the women of our country
"wake up, he repeatedly insisted, their voice will be unmistakably"
confident in its utterance of the cry:  I want. 

 I want!   Sandip went on one day--this was the primal word at
"the root of all creation.  It had no maxim to guide it, but it"
became fire and wrought itself into suns and stars.  Its
"partiality is terrible.  Because it had a desire for man, it"
ruthlessly sacrificed millions of beasts for millions of years to
achieve that desire.  That terrible word  I want  has taken flesh
"in woman, and therefore men, who are cowards, try with all their"
might to keep back this primeval flood With their earthen dykes.
"They are afraid lest, laughing and dancing as it goes, it should"
"wash away all the hedges and props of their pumpkin field.  Men,"
"in every age, flatter themselves that they have secured this"
"force within the bounds of their convenience, but it gathers and"
"grows.  Now it is calm and deep like a lake, but gradually its"
"pressure will increase, the dykes will give way, and the force"
which has so long been dumb will rush forward with the roar:  I
want! 

These words of Sandip echo in my heart-beats like a war-drum.
They shame into silence all my conflicts with myself.  What do I
care what people may think of me?  Of what value are that orchid
and that niche in my bedroom?  What power have they to belittle
"me, to put me to shame?  The primal fire of creation burns in me."

I felt a strong desire to snatch down the orchid and fling it out
"of the window, to denude the niche of its picture, to lay bare"
and naked the unashamed spirit of destruction that raged within
"me.  My arm was raised to do it, but a sudden pang passed through"
"my breast, tears started to my eyes.  I threw myself down and"
"sobbed:  What is the end of all this, what is the end? "



Sandip s Story

IV



When I read these pages of the story of my life I seriously
question myself: Is this Sandip?  Am I made of words?  Am I
merely a book with a covering of flesh and blood?

The earth is not a dead thing like the moon.  She breathes.  Her
rivers and oceans send up vapours in which she is clothed.  She
is covered with a mantle of her own dust which flies about the
"air.  The onlooker, gazing upon the earth from the outside, can"
see only the light reflected from this vapour and this dust.  The
tracks of the mighty continents are not distinctly visible.

"The man, who is alive as this earth is, is likewise always"
enveloped in the mist of the ideas which he is breathing out.
"His real land and water remain hidden, and he appears to be made"
of only lights and shadows.

"It seems to me, in this story of my life, that, like a living"
"plant, I am displaying the picture of an ideal world.  But I am"
"not merely what I want, what I think--I am also what I do not"
"love, what I do not wish to be.  My creation had begun before I"
was born.  I had no choice in regard to my surroundings and so
must make the best of such material as comes to my hand.

My theory of life makes me certain that the Great is cruel To be
just is for ordinary men--it is reserved for the great to be
unjust.  The surface of the earth was even.  The volcano butted
it with its fiery horn and found its own eminence--its justice
"was not towards its obstacle, but towards itself.  Successful"
injustice and genuine cruelty have been the only forces by which
individual or nation has become millionaire or monarch.

That is why I preach the great discipline of Injustice.  I say to
everyone: Deliverance is based upon injustice.  Injustice is the
fire which must keep on burning something in order to save itself
from becoming ashes.  Whenever an individual or nation becomes
incapable of perpetrating injustice it is swept into the dust-bin
of the world.

As yet this is only my idea--it is not completely myself.  There
are rifts in the armour through which something peeps out which
"is extremely soft and sensitive.  Because, as I say, the best"
part of myself was created before I came to this stage of
existence.

From time to time I try my followers in their lesson of cruelty.
One day we went on a picnic.  A goat was grazing by.  I asked
them:  Who is there among you that can cut off a leg of that
"goat, alive, with this knife, and bring it to me?   While they"
"all hesitated, I went myself and did it.  One of them fainted at"
the sight.  But when they saw me unmoved they took the dust of my
"feet, saying that I was above all human weaknesses.  That is to"
"say, they saw that day the vaporous envelope which was my idea,"
"but failed to perceive the inner me, which by a curious freak of"
fate has been created tender and merciful.

"In the present chapter of my life, which is growing in interest"
"every day round Bimala and Nikhil, there is also much that"
remains hidden underneath.  This malady of ideas which afflicts
me is shaping my life within: nevertheless a great part of my
life remains outside its influence; and so there is set up a
discrepancy between my outward life and its inner design which I
try my best to keep concealed even from myself; otherwise it may
"wreck not only my plans, but my very life."

"Life is indefinite--a bundle of contradictions.  We men, with our"
"ideas, strive to give it a particular shape by melting it into a"
particular mould--into the definiteness of success.  All the
"world-conquerors, from Alexander down to the American"
"millionaires, mould themselves into a sword or a mint, and thus"
find that distinct image of themselves which is the source of
their success.

The chief controversy between Nikhil and myself arises from this:
"that though I say  know thyself , and Nikhil also says  know"
"thyself , his interpretation makes this  knowing  tantamount to"
 not knowing .

" Winning your kind of success,  Nikhil once objected,  is success"
gained at the cost of the soul: but the soul is greater than
success. 

I simply said in answer:  Your words are too vague. 

" That I cannot help,  Nikhil replied.   A machine is distinct"
"enough, but not so life.  If to gain distinctness you try to know"
"life as a machine, then such mere distinctness cannot stand for"
"truth.  The soul is not as distinct as success, and so you only"
lose your soul if you seek it in your success. 

" Where, then, is this wonderful soul? "

 Where it knows itself in the infinite and transcends its
success. 

 But how does all this apply to our work for the country? 

 It is the same thing.  Where our country makes itself the final
"object, it gains success at the cost of the soul.  Where it"
"recognizes the Greatest as greater than all, there it may miss"
"success, but gains its soul. "

 Is there any example of this in history? 

" Man is so great that he can despise not only the success, but"
"also the example.  Possibly example is lacking, just as there is"
no example of the flower in the seed.  But there is the urgence
of the flower in the seed all the same. 

It is not that I do not at all understand Nikhil s point of view;
that is rather where my danger lies.  I was born in India and the
poison of its spirituality runs in my blood.  However loudly I
may proclaim the madness of walking in the path of self-
"abnegation, I cannot avoid it altogether."

This is exactly how such curious anomalies happen nowadays in our
country.  We must have our religion and also our nationalism; our
  Bhagavadgita   and also our   Bande Mataram  .  The result is that
both of them suffer.  It is like performing with an English military
"band, side by side with our Indian festive pipes.  I must make it"
the purpose of my life to put an end to this hideous confusion.

"I want the western military style to prevail, not the Indian."
"We shall then not be ashamed of the flag of our passion, which"
mother Nature has sent with us as our standard into the
battlefield of life.  Passion is beautiful and pure--pure as the
lily that comes out of the slimy soil.  It rises superior to its
defilement and needs no Pears  soap to wash it clean.



V


A question has been worrying me the last few days.  Why am I
allowing my life to become entangled with Bimala s?  Am I a
drifting log to be caught up at any and every obstacle?

Not that I have any false shame at Bimala becoming an object of
"my desire.  It is only too clear how she wants me, and so I look"
on her as quite legitimately mine.  The fruit hangs on the branch
"by the stem, but that is no reason why the claim of the stem"
should be eternal.  Ripe fruit cannot for ever swear by its
slackening stem-hold.  All its sweetness has been accumulated for
me; to surrender itself to my hand is the reason of its
"existence, its very nature, its true morality.  So I must pluck"
"it, for it becomes me not to make it futile."

But what is teasing me is that I am getting entangled.  Am I not
"born to rule?--to bestride my proper steed, the crowd, and drive"
"it as I will; the reins in my hand, the destination known only to"
"me, and for it the thorns, the mire, on the road?  This steed now"
"awaits me at the door, pawing and champing its bit, its neighing"
"filling the skies.  But where am I, and what am I about, letting"
day after day of golden opportunity slip by?

I used to think I was like a storm--that the torn flowers with
which I strewed my path would not impede my progress.  But I am
only wandering round and round a flower like a bee--not a storm.
"So, as I was saying, the colouring of ideas which man gives"
himself is only superficial.  The inner man remains as ordinary
"as ever.  If someone, who could see right into me, were to write"
"my biography, he would make me out to be no different from that"
"lout of a Panchu, or even from Nikhil!"

Last night I was turning over the pages of my old diary ...  I
"had just graduated, and my brain was bursting with philosophy."
"Even so early I had vowed not to harbour any illusions, whether"
"of my own or other s imagining, but to build my life on a solid"
basis of reality.  But what has since been its actual story?
"Where is its solidity?  It has rather been a network, where,"
"though the thread be continuous, more space is taken up by the"
"holes.  Fight as I may, these will not own defeat.  Just as I was"
"congratulating myself on steadily following the thread, here I am"
badly caught in a hole!  For I have become susceptible to
compunctions.

" I want it; it is here; let me take it --This is a clear-cut,"
straightforward policy.  Those who can pursue its course with
vigour needs must win through in the end.  But the gods would not
"have it that such journey should be easy, so they have deputed"
"the siren Sympathy to distract the wayfarer, to dim his vision"
with her tearful mist.

I can see that poor Bimala is struggling like a snared deer.
What a piteous alarm there is in her eyes!  How she is torn with
"straining at her bonds!  This sight, of course, should gladden"
"the heart of a true hunter.  And so do I rejoice; but, then, I am"
"also touched; and therefore I dally, and standing on the brink I"
am hesitating to pull the noose fast.

"There have been moments, I know, when I could have bounded up to"
"her, clasped her hands and folded her to my breast, unresisting."
"Had I done so, she would not have said one word.  She was aware"
"that some crisis was impending, which in a moment would change"
the meaning of the whole world.  Standing before that cavern of
"the incalculable but yet expected, her face went pale and her"
"eyes glowed with a fearful ecstasy.  Within that moment, when it"
"arrives, an eternity will take shape, which our destiny awaits,"
holding its breath.

"But I have let this moment slip by.  I did not, with"
"uncompromising strength, press the almost certain into the"
absolutely assured.  I now see clearly that some hidden elements
in my nature have openly ranged themselves as obstacles in my
path.

"That is exactly how Ravana, whom I look upon as the real hero of"
"the   Ramayana  , met with his doom.  He kept Sita in his"
"Asoka garden, awaiting her pleasure, instead of taking her"
straight into his harem.  This weak spot in his otherwise grand
character made the whole of the abduction episode futile.
"Another such touch of compunction made him disregard, and be"
"lenient to, his traitorous brother Bibhisan, only to get himself"
killed for his pains.

Thus does the tragic in life come by its own.  In the beginning
"it lies, a little thing, in some dark under-vault, and ends by"
"overthrowing the whole superstructure.  The real tragedy is, that"
man does not know himself for what he really is.

VI



"Then again there is Nikhil.  Crank though he be, laugh at him as"
"I may, I cannot get rid of the idea that he is my friend.  At"
"first I gave no thought to his point of view, but of late it has"
begun to shame and hurt me.  Therefore I have been trying to talk
"and argue with him in the same enthusiastic way as of old, but it"
does not ring true.  It is even leading me at times into such a
length of unnaturalness as to pretend to agree with him.  But
"such hypocrisy is not in my nature, nor in that of Nikhil either."
"This, at least, is something we have in common.  That is why,"
"nowadays, I would rather not come across him, and have taken to"
fighting shy of his presence.

All these are signs of weakness.  No sooner is the possibility of
"a wrong admitted than it becomes actual, and clutches you by the"
"throat, however you may then try to shake off all belief in it."
"What I should like to be able to tell Nikhil frankly is, that"
happenings such as these must be looked in the face--as great
Realities--and that which is the Truth should not be allowed to
stand between true friends.

There is no denying that I have really weakened.  It was not this
weakness which won over Bimala; she burnt her wings in the blaze
of the full strength of my unhesitating manliness.  Whenever
"smoke obscures its lustre she also becomes confused, and draws"
"back.  Then comes a thorough revulsion of feeling, and she fain"
"would take back the garland she has put round my neck, but"
"cannot; and so she only closes her eyes, to shut it out of sight."

But all the same I must not swerve from the path I have chalked
"out.  It would never do to abandon the cause of the country,"
especially at the present time.  I shall simply make Bimala one
with my country.  The turbulent west wind which has swept away
"the country s veil of conscience, will sweep away the veil of the"
"wife from Bimala s face, and in that uncovering there will be no"
shame.  The ship will rock as it bears the crowd across the
"ocean, flying the pennant of   Bande Mataram  , and it will"
"serve as the cradle to my power, as well as to my love."

"Bimala will see such a majestic vision of deliverance, that her"
"bonds will slip from about her, without shame, without her even"
being aware of it.  Fascinated by the beauty of this terrible
"wrecking power, she will not hesitate a moment to be cruel.  I"
have seen in Bimala s nature the cruelty which is the inherent
force of existence--the cruelty which with its unrelenting might
keeps the world beautiful.

If only women could be set free from the artificial fetters put
"round them by men, we could see on earth the living image of"
"Kali, the shameless, pitiless goddess.  I am a worshipper of"
"Kali, and one day I shall truly worship her, setting Bimala on"
her altar of Destruction.  For this let me get ready.

The way of retreat is absolutely closed for both of us.  We shall
despoil each other: get to hate each other: but never more be
free.

Nikhil s Story

IV



EVERYTHING is rippling and waving with the flood of August.  The
young shoots of rice have the sheen of an infant s limbs.  The
water has invaded the garden next to our house.  The morning
"light, like the love of the blue sky, is lavished upon the earth"
...  Why cannot I sing?  The water of the distant river is
shimmering with light; the leaves are glistening; the rice-
"fields, with their fitful shivers, break into gleams of gold; and"
"in this symphony of Autumn, only I remain voiceless.  The"
"sunshine of the world strikes my heart, but is not reflected"
back.

"When I realize the lack of expressiveness in myself, I know why I"
am deprived.  Who could bear my company day and night without a
"break?  Bimala is full of the energy of life, and so she has"
"never become stale to me for a moment, in all these nine years of"
our wedded life.

My life has only its dumb depths; but no murmuring rush.  I can
only receive: not impart movement.  And therefore my company is
like fasting.  I recognize clearly today that Bimala has been
languishing because of a famine of companionship.

Then whom shall I blame?  Like Vidyapati I can only lament:

/*
"  It is August, the sky breaks into a passionate rain;"
"  Alas, empty is my house."
*/

"My house, I now see, was built to remain empty, because its doors"
cannot open.  But I never knew till now that its divinity had
been sitting outside.  I had fondly believed that she had
"accepted my sacrifice, and granted in return her boon.  But,"
"alas, my house has all along been empty."

"Every year, about this time, it was our practice to go in a"
house-boat over the broads of Samalda.  I used to tell Bimala
that a song must come back to its refrain over and over again.
"The original refrain of every song is in Nature, where the rain-"
"laden wind passes over the rippling stream, where the green"
"earth, drawing its shadow-veil over its face, keeps its ear close"
"to the speaking water.  There, at the beginning of time, a man"
and a woman first met--not within walls.  And therefore we two
"must come back to Nature, at least once a year, to tune our love"
anew to the first pure note of the meeting of hearts.

The first two anniversaries of our married life I spent in
"Calcutta, where I went through my examinations.  But from the"
"next year onwards, for seven years without a break, we have"
celebrated our union among the blossoming water-lilies.  Now
begins the next octave of my life.

It was difficult for me to ignore the fact that the same month of
"August had come round again this year.  Does Bimala remember it,"
I wonder?--she has given me no reminder.  Everything is mute
about me.

/*
"  It is August, the sky breaks into a passionate rain;"
"  Alas, empty is my house."
*/

"The house which becomes empty through the parting of lovers,"
still has music left in the heart of its emptiness.  But the
"house that is empty because hearts are asunder, is awful in its"
silence.  Even the cry of pain is out of place there.

This cry of pain must be silenced in me.  So long as I continue
"to suffer, Bimala will never have true freedom.  I must free her"
"completely, otherwise I shall never gain my freedom from untruth"
...

I think I have come to the verge of understanding one thing.  Man
"has so fanned the flame of the loves of men and women, as to make"
"it overpass its rightful domain, and now, even in the name of"
"humanity itself, he cannot bring it back under control.  Man s"
worship has idolized his passion.  But there must be no more
human sacrifices at its shrine ...

"I went into my bedroom this morning, to fetch a book.  It is long"
since I have been there in the day-time.  A pang passed through
"me as I looked round it today, in the morning light.  On the"
"clothes rack was hanging a   sari   of Bimala s, crinkled"
"ready for wear.  On the dressing-table were her perfumes, her"
"comb, her hair-pins, and with them, still, her vermilion box!"
Underneath were her tiny gold-embroidered slippers.

"Once, in the old days, when Bimala had not yet overcome her"
"objections to shoes, I had got these out from Lucknow, to tempt"
"her.  The first time she was ready to drop for very shame, to go"
in them even from the room to the verandah.  Since then she has
"worn out many shoes, but has treasured up this pair.  When first"
"showing her the slippers, I chaffed her over a curious practice"
"of hers;  I have caught you taking the dust of my feet, thinking"
me asleep!  These are the offerings of my worship to ward the
dust off the feet of my wakeful divinity.    You must not say
"such things,  she protested,  or I will never wear your shoes! "

This bedroom of mine--it has a subtle atmosphere which goes
"straight to my heart.  I was never aware, as I am today, how my"
thirsting heart has been sending out its roots to cling round
"each and every familiar object.  The severing of the main root, I"
"see, is not enough to set life free.  Even these little slippers"
serve to hold one back.

My wandering eyes fall on the niche.  My portrait there is
"looking the same as ever, in spite of the flowers scattered round"
it having been withered black!  Of all the things in the room
their greeting strikes me as sincere.  They are still here simply
because it was not felt worth while even to remove them.  Never
"mind; let me welcome truth, albeit in such sere and sorry garb,"
and look forward to the time when I shall be able to do so
"unmoved, as does my photograph."

"As I stood there, Bimal came in from behind.  I hastily turned my"
eyes from the niche to the shelves as I muttered:  I came to get
Amiel s Journal.   What need had Ito volunteer an explanation?  I
"felt like a wrong-doer, a trespasser, prying into a secret not"
"meant for me.  I could not look Bimal in the face, but hurried"
away.

V



I had just made the discovery that it was useless to keep up a
"pretence of reading in my room outside, and also that it was"
equally beyond me to busy myself attending to anything at all--so
that all the days of my future bid fair to congeal into one solid
"mass and settle heavily on my breast for good--when Panchu, the"
"tenant of a neighbouring   zamindar  , came up to me with a"
basketful of cocoa-nuts and greeted me with a profound obeisance.

" Well, Panchu,  said I.   What is all this for? "

I had got to know Panchu through my master.  He was extremely
"poor, nor was I in a position to do anything for him; so I"
supposed this present was intended to procure a tip to help the
poor fellow to make both ends meet.  I took some money from my
"purse and held it out towards him, but with folded hands he"
"protested:  I cannot take that, sir! "

" Why, what is the matter? "

" Let me make a clean breast of it, sir.  Once, when I was hard"
"pressed, I stole some cocoa-nuts from the garden here.  I am"
"getting old, and may die any day, so I have come to pay them"
back. 

Amiel s Journal could not have done me any good that day.  But
these words of Panchu lightened my heart.  There are more things
in life than the union or separation of man and woman.  The great
"world stretches far beyond, and one can truly measure one s joys"
and sorrows when standing in its midst.

Panchu was devoted to my master.  I know well enough how he
"manages to eke out a livelihood.  He is up before dawn every day,"
"and with a basket of   pan   leaves, twists of tobacco,"
"coloured cotton yarn, little combs, looking-glasses, and other"
"trinkets beloved of the village women, he wades through the knee-"
deep water of the marsh and goes over to the Namasudra quarters.
"There he barters his goods for rice, which fetches him a little"
more than their price in money.  If he can get back soon enough
"he goes out again, after a hurried meal, to the sweetmeat"
"seller s, where he assists in beating sugar for wafers.  As soon"
"as he comes home he sits at his shell-bangle making, plodding on"
"often till midnight.  All this cruel toil does not earn, for"
"himself and his family, a bare two meals a day during much more"
than half the year.  His method of eating is to begin with a good
"filling draught of water, and his staple food is the cheapest"
kind of seedy banana.  And yet the family has to go with only one
meal a day for the rest of the year.

"At one time I had an idea of making him a charity allowance,"
" But,  said my master,  your gift may destroy the man, it cannot"
destroy the hardship of his lot.  Mother Bengal has not only this
"one Panchu.  If the milk in her breasts has run dry, that cannot"
be supplied from the outside. 

"These are thoughts which give one pause, and I decided to devote"
myself to working it out.  That very day I said to Bimal:  Let us
dedicate our lives to removing the root of this sorrow in our
country. 

" You are my Prince Siddharta, [17] I see,  she replied with a"
smile.   But do not let the torrent of your feelings end by
sweeping me away also! 

 Siddharta took his vows alone.  I want ours to be a joint
arrangement. 

"The idea passed away in talk.  The fact is, Bimala is at heart"
"what is called a  lady .  Though her own people are not well off,"
she was born a Rani.  She has no doubts in her mind that there is
a lower unit of measure for the trials and troubles of the  lower
"classes .  Want is, of course, a permanent feature of their"
"lives, but does not necessarily mean  want  to them.  Their very"
"smallness protects them, as the banks protect the pool; by"
widening bounds only the slime is exposed.

"The real fact is that Bimala has only come into my home, not into"
"my life.  I had magnified her so, leaving her such a large place,"
"that when I lost her, my whole way of life became narrow and"
confined.  I had thrust aside all other objects into a corner to
make room for Bimala--taken up as I was with decorating her and
dressing her and educating her and moving round her day and
night; forgetting how great is humanity and how nobly precious is
man s life.  When the actualities of everyday things get the
"better of the man, then is Truth lost sight of and freedom"
missed.  So painfully important did Bimala make the mere
"actualities, that the truth remained concealed from me.  That is"
"why I find no gap in my misery, and spread this minute point of"
"my emptiness over all the world.  And so, for hours on this"
"Autumn morning, the refrain has been humming in my ears:"

/*
"  It is the month of August, and the sky breaks into a passionate"
    rain;
"  Alas, my house is empty."
*/

Bimala s Story

XI



"The change which had, in a moment, come over the mind of Bengal"
was tremendous.  It was as if the Ganges had touched the ashes of
the sixty thousand sons of Sagar [18] which no fire could
"enkindle, no other water knead again into living clay.  The ashes"
of lifeless Bengal suddenly spoke up:  Here am I. 

I have read somewhere that in ancient Greece a sculptor had the
good fortune to impart life to the image made by his own hand.
"Even in that miracle, however, there was the process of form"
preceding life.  But where was the unity in this heap of barren
"ashes?  Had they been hard like stone, we might have had hopes of"
"some form emerging, even as Ahalya, though turned to stone, at"
last won back her humanity.  But these scattered ashes must have
"dropped to the dust through gaps in the Creator s fingers, to be"
"blown hither and thither by the wind.  They had become heaped up,"
but were never before united.  Yet in this day which had come to
"Bengal, even this collection of looseness had taken shape, and"
"proclaimed in a thundering voice, at our very door:  Here I am. "

How could we help thinking that it was all supernatural?  This
moment of our history seemed to have dropped into our hand like a
jewel from the crown of some drunken god.  It had no resemblance
to our past; and so we were led to hope that all our wants and
"miseries would disappear by the spell of some magic charm, that"
for us there was no longer any boundary line between the possible
and the impossible.  Everything seemed to be saying to us:  It is
coming; it has come! 

Thus we came to cherish the belief that our history needed no
"steed, but that like heaven s chariot it would move with its own"
inherent power--At least no wages would have to be paid to the
charioteer; only his wine cup would have to be filled again and
again.  And then in some impossible paradise the goal of our
hopes would be reached.

"My husband was not altogether unmoved, but through all our"
excitement it was the strain of sadness in him which deepened and
deepened.  He seemed to have a vision of something beyond the
surging present.

"I remember one day, in the course of the arguments he continually"
"had with Sandip, he said:  Good fortune comes to our gate and"
"announces itself, only to prove that we have not the power to"
receive it--that we have not kept things ready to be able to
invite it into our house. 

" No,  was Sandip s answer.   You talk like an atheist because you"
do not believe in our gods.  To us it has been made quite visible
"that the Goddess has come with her boon, yet you distrust the"
obvious signs of her presence. 

" It is because I strongly believe in my God,  said my husband,"
 that I feel so certain that our preparations for his worship are
"lacking.  God has power to give the boon, but we must have power"
to accept it. 

This kind of talk from my husband would only annoy me.  I could
not keep from joining in:  You think this excitement is only a
"fire of drunkenness, but does not drunkenness, up to a point,"
give strength? 

" Yes,  my husband replied.   It may give strength, but not"
weapons. 

" But strength is the gift of God,  I went on.   Weapons can be"
supplied by mere mechanics. 

My husband smiled.   The mechanics will claim their wages before
"they deliver their supplies,  he said."

Sandip swelled his chest as he retorted:  Don t you trouble about
that.  Their wages shall be paid. 

 I shall bespeak the festive music when the payment has been
"made, not before,  my husband answered."

 You needn t imagine that we are depending on your bounty for the
"music,  said Sandip scornfully.   Our festival is above all money"
payments. 

And in his thick voice he began to sing:

/*
"   My lover of the unpriced love, spurning payments,"
"  Plays upon the simple pipe, bought for nothing,"
  Drawing my heart away. 
*/

"Then with a smile he turned to me and said:  If I sing, Queen"
"Bee, it is only to prove that when music comes into one s life,"
the lack of a good voice is no matter.  When we sing merely on
"the strength of our tunefulness, the song is belittled.  Now that"
"a full flood of music has swept over our country, let Nikhil"
"practise his scales, while we rouse the land with our cracked"
voices:

/*
   My house cries to me: Why go out to lose your all?
"  My life says: All that you have, fling to the winds!"
"  If we must lose our all, let us lose it: what is it worth after"
    all?
"  If I must court ruin, let me do it smilingly;"
  For my quest is the death-draught of immortality.
*/

" The truth is, Nikhil, that we have all lost our hearts.  None"
"can hold us any longer within the bounds of the easily possible,"
in our forward rush to the hopelessly impossible.

/*
"   Those who would draw us back,"
  They know not the fearful joy of recklessness.
  They know not that we have had our call
  From the end of the crooked path.
  All that is good and straight and trim--
  Let it topple over in the dust. 
*/

"I thought that my husband was going to continue the discussion,"
but he rose silently from his seat and left us.

The thing that was agitating me within was merely a variation of
"the stormy passion outside, which swept the country from one end"
to the other.  The car of the wielder of my destiny was fast
"approaching, and the sound of its wheels reverberated in my"
being.  I had a constant feeling that something extraordinary
"might happen any moment, for which, however, the responsibility"
would not be mine.  Was I not removed from the plane in which
"right and wrong, and the feelings of others, have to be"
considered?  Had I ever wanted this--had I ever been waiting or
hoping for any such thing?  Look at my whole life and tell me
"then, if I was in any way accountable."

Through all my past I had been consistent in my devotion--but
"when at length it came to receiving the boon, a different god"
"appeared!  And just as the awakened country, with its   Bande"
"Mataram  , thrills in salutation to the unrealized future"
"before it, so do all my veins and nerves send forth shocks of"
"welcome to the unthought-of, the unknown, the importunate"
Stranger.

One night I left my bed and slipped out of my room on to the open
terrace.  Beyond our garden wall are fields of ripening rice.
"Through the gaps in the village groves to the North, glimpses of"
the river are seen.  The whole scene slept in the darkness like
the vague embryo of some future creation.

"In that future I saw my country, a woman like myself, standing"
expectant.  She has been drawn forth from her home corner by the
sudden call of some Unknown.  She has had no time to pause or
"ponder, or to light herself a torch, as she rushes forward into"
the darkness ahead.  I know well how her very soul responds to
the distant flute-strains which call her; how her breast rises
"and falls; how she feels she nears it, nay it is already hers, so"
that it matters not even if she run blindfold.  She is no mother.
"There is no call to her of children in their hunger, no home to"
"be lighted of an evening, no household work to be done.  So; she"
"hies to her tryst, for this is the land of the Vaishnava Poets."
"She has left home, forgotten domestic duties; she has nothing but"
"an unfathomable yearning which hurries her on--by what road, to"
"what goal, she recks not."

"I, also, am possessed of just such a yearning.  I likewise have"
lost my home and also lost my way.  Both the end and the means
have become equally shadowy to me.  There remain only the
yearning and the hurrying on.  Ah!  wretched wanderer through the
"night, when the dawn reddens you will see no trace of a way to"
return.  But why return?  Death will serve as well.  If the Dark
"which sounded the flute should lead to destruction, why trouble"
"about the hereafter?  When I am merged in its blackness, neither"
"I, nor good and bad, nor laughter, nor tears, shall be any more!"

was such that they could only be restored to life if the stream
of the Ganges was brought down to them.  [Trans.].

In Bengal the machinery of time being thus suddenly run at full
"pressure, things which were difficult became easy, one following"
"soon after another.  Nothing could be held back any more, even in"
our corner of the country.  In the beginning our district was
"backward, for my husband was unwilling to put any compulsion on"
the villagers.   Those who make sacrifices for their country s
"sake are indeed her servants,  he would say,  but those who"
compel others to make them in her name are her enemies.  They
"would cut freedom at the root, to gain it at the top. "

"But when Sandip came and settled here, and his followers began to"
"move about the country, speaking in towns and market-places,"
waves of excitement came rolling up to us as well.  A band of
"young fellows of the locality attached themselves to him, some"
even who had been known as a disgrace to the village.  But the
"glow of their genuine enthusiasm lighted them up, within as well"
as without.  It became quite clear that when the pure breezes of
"a great joy and hope sweep through the land, all dirt and decay"
"are cleansed away.  It is hard, indeed, for men to be frank and"
"straight and healthy, when their country is in the throes of"
dejection.

"Then were all eyes turned on my husband, from whose estates alone"
foreign sugar and salt and cloths had not been banished.  Even
the estate officers began to feel awkward and ashamed over it.
"And yet, some time ago, when my husband began to import country-"
"made articles into our village, he had been secretly and openly"
"twitted for his folly, by old and young alike.  When"
"  Swadeshi   had not yet become a boast, we had despised it"
with all our hearts.

My husband still sharpens his Indian-made pencils with his
"Indian-made knife, does his writing with reed pens, drinks his"
"water out of a bell-metal vessel, and works at night in the light"
"of an old-fashioned castor-oil lamp.  But this dull, milk-and-"
"water   Swadeshi   of his never appealed to us.  Rather, we"
"had always felt ashamed of the inelegant, unfashionable furniture"
"of his reception-rooms, especially when he had the magistrate, or"
"any other European, as his guest."

My husband used to make light of my protests.   Why allow such
trifles to upset you?   he would say with a smile.

" They will think us barbarians, or at all events wanting in"
refinement. 

" If they do, I will pay them back by thinking that their"
refinement does not go deeper than their white skins. 

My husband had an ordinary brass pot on his writing-table which
"he used as a flower-vase.  It has often happened that, when I had"
"news of some European guest, I would steal into his room and put"
"in its place a crystal vase of European make.   Look here,"
"Bimala,  he objected at length,  that brass pot is as unconscious"
of itself as those blossoms are; but this thing protests its
"purpose so loudly, it is only fit for artificial flowers. "

"The Bara Rani, alone, pandered to my husband s whims.  Once she"
"comes panting to say:  Oh, brother, have you heard?  Such lovely"
Indian soaps have come out!  My days of luxury are gone by;
"still, if they contain no animal fat, I should like to try some. "

"This sort of thing makes my husband beam all over, and the house"
is deluged with Indian scents and soaps.  Soaps indeed!  They are
more like lumps of caustic soda.  And do I not know that what my
"sister-in-law uses on herself are the European soaps of old,"
while these are made over to the maids for washing clothes?

"Another time it is:  Oh, brother dear, do get me some of these"
new Indian pen-holders. 

"Her  brother  bubbles up as usual, and the Bara Rani s room"
becomes littered with all kinds of awful sticks that go by the
name of   Swadeshi   pen-holders.  Not that it makes any
"difference to her, for reading and writing are out of her line."
"Still, in her writing-case, lies the selfsame ivory pen-holder,"
the only one ever handled.

"The fact is, all this was intended as a hit at me, because I"
would not keep my husband company in his vagaries.  It was no
good trying to show up my sister-in-law s insincerity; my
"husband s face would set so hard, if I barely touched on it.  One"
"only gets into trouble, trying to save such people from being"
imposed upon!

The Bara Rani loves sewing.  One day I could not help blurting
"out:  What a humbug you are, sister!  When your  brother  is"
"present, your mouth waters at the very mention of   Swadeshi  "
"scissors, but it is the English-made article every time when you"
work. 

 What harm?   she replied.   Do you not see what pleasure it
"gives him?  We have grown up together in this house, since he was"
"a boy.  I simply cannot bear, as you can, the sight of the smile"
"leaving his face.  Poor dear, he has no amusement except this"
"playing at shop-keeping.  You are his only dissipation, and you"
will yet be his ruin! 

" Whatever you may say, it is not right to be double-faced,  I"
retorted.

"My sister-in-law laughed out in my face.   Oh, our artless little"
"Chota Rani!--straight as a schoolmaster s rod, eh?  But a woman"
"is not built that way.  She is soft and supple, so that she may"
bend without being crooked. 

"I could not forget those words:  You are his dissipation, and"
will be his ruin!   Today I feel--if a man needs must have some
"intoxicant, let it not be a woman."

"Suksar, within our estates, is one of the biggest trade centres"
in the district.  On one side of a stretch of water there is held
"a daily bazar; on the other, a weekly market.  During the rains"
"when this piece of water gets connected with the river, and boats"
"can come through, great quantities of cotton yarns, and woollen"
"stuffs for the coming winter, are brought in for sale."

"At the height of our enthusiasm, Sandip laid it down that all"
"foreign articles, together with the demon of foreign influence,"
must be driven out of our territory.

" Of course!   said I, girding myself up for a fight."

" I have had words with Nikhil about it,  said Sandip.   He tells"
"me, he does not mind speechifying, but he will not have"
coercion. 

" I will see to that,  I said, with a proud sense of power.  I"
knew how deep was my husband s love for me.  Had I been in my
senses I should have allowed myself to be torn to pieces rather
"than assert my claim to that, at such a time.  But Sandip had to"
be impressed with the full strength of my   Shakti  .

"Sandip had brought home to me, in his irresistible way, how the"
cosmic Energy was revealed for each individual in the shape of
"some special affinity.  Vaishnava Philosophy, he said, speaks of"
the   Shakti   of Delight that dwells in the heart of
"creation, ever attracting the heart of her Eternal Lover.  Men"
have a perpetual longing to bring out this   Shakti   from the
"hidden depths of their own nature, and those of us who succeed in"
doing so at once clearly understand the meaning of the music
coming to us from the Dark.  He broke out singing:

/*
"   My flute, that was busy with its song,"
  Is silent now when we stand face to face.
  My call went seeking you from sky to sky
    When you lay hidden;
  But now all my cry finds its smile
    In the face of my beloved. 
*/

"Listening to his allegories, I had forgotten that I was plain and"
simple Bimala.  I was   Shakti  ; also an embodiment of
"Universal joy.  Nothing could fetter me, nothing was impossible"
for me; whatever I touched would gain new life.  The world around
"me was a fresh creation of mine; for behold, before my heart s"
"response had touched it, there had not been this wealth of gold"
"in the Autumn sky!  And this hero, this true servant of the"
"country, this devotee of mine--this flaming intelligence, this"
"burning energy, this shining genius--him also was I creating from"
moment to moment.  Have I not seen how my presence pours fresh
life into him time after time?

"The other day Sandip begged me to receive a young lad, Amulya, an"
ardent disciple of his.  In a moment I could see a new light
"flash out from the boy s eyes, and knew that he, too, had a"
"vision of   Shakti   manifest, that my creative force had"
begun its work in his blood.   What sorcery is this of yours! 
"exclaimed Sandip next day.   Amulya is a boy no longer, the wick"
of his life is all ablaze.  Who can hide your fire under your
"home-roof?  Every one of them must be touched up by it, sooner or"
"later, and when every lamp is alight what a grand carnival of a"
  Dewali   we shall have in the country! 

Blinded with the brilliance of my own glory I had decided to
grant my devotee this boon.  I was overweeningly confident that
none could baulk me of what I really wanted.  When I returned to
"my room after my talk with Sandip, I loosed my hair and tied it"
up over again.  Miss Gilby had taught me a way of brushing it up
from the neck and piling it in a knot over my head.  This style
"was a favourite one with my husband.   It is a pity,  he once"
"said,  that Providence should have chosen poor me, instead of"
"poet Kalidas, for revealing all the wonders of a woman s neck."
The poet would probably have likened it to a flower-stem; but I
"feel it to be a torch, holding aloft the black flame of your"
"hair.   With which he ...  but why, oh why, do I go back to all"
that?

I sent for my husband.  In the old days I could contrive a
"hundred and one excuses, good or bad, to get him to come to me."
Now that all this had stopped for days I had lost the art of
contriving.



Nikhil s Story

VI



Panchu s wife has just died of a lingering consumption.  Panchu
must undergo a purification ceremony to cleanse himself of sin
and to propitiate his community.  The community has calculated
and informed him that it will cost one hundred and twenty-three
rupees.

" How absurd!   I cried, highly indignant.   Don t submit to this,"
Panchu.  What can they do to you? 

Raising to me his patient eyes like those of a tired-out beast of
"burden, he said:  There is my eldest girl, sir, she will have to"
be married.  And my poor wife s last rites have to be put
through. 

" Even if the sin were yours, Panchu,  I mused aloud,  you have"
surely suffered enough for it already. 

" That is so, sir,  he navely assented.   I had to sell part of"
my land and mortgage the rest to meet the doctor s bills.  But
there is no escape from the offerings I have to make the
Brahmins. 

"What was the use of arguing?  When will come the time, I"
"wondered, for the purification of the Brahmins themselves who can"
accept such offerings?

"After his wife s illness and funeral, Panchu, who had been"
"tottering on the brink of starvation, went altogether beyond his"
depth.  In a desperate attempt to gain consolation of some sort
"he took to sitting at the feet of a wandering ascetic, and"
succeeded in acquiring philosophy enough to forget that his
children went hungry.  He kept himself steeped for a time in the
"idea that the world is vanity, and if of pleasure it has none,"
"pain also is a delusion.  Then, at last, one night he left his"
"little ones in their tumble-down hovel, and started off wandering"
on his own account.

"I knew nothing of this at the time, for just then a veritable"
ocean-churning by gods and demons was going on in my mind.  Nor
did my master tell me that he had taken Panchu s deserted
"children under his own roof and was caring for them, though alone"
"in the house, with his school to attend to the whole day."

"After a month Panchu came back, his ascetic fervour considerably"
"worn off.  His eldest boy and girl nestled up to him, crying:"
" Where have you been all this time, father?   His youngest boy"
filled his lap; his second girl leant over his back with her arms
around his neck; and they all wept together.   O sir!   sobbed
"Panchu, at length, to my master.   I have not the power to give"
these little ones enough to eat--I am not free to run away from
"them.  What has been my sin that I should be scourged so, bound"
hand and foot? 

In the meantime the thread of Panchu s little trade connections
had snapped and he found he could not resume them.  He clung on
"to the shelter of my master s roof, which had first received him"
"on his return, and said not a word of going back home.   Look"
"here, Panchu,  my master was at last driven to say.   If you"
"don t take care of your cottage, it will tumble down altogether."
I will lend you some money with which you can do a bit of
peddling and return it me little by little. 

Panchu was not excessively pleased--was there then no such thing
as charity on earth?  And when my master asked him to write out a
"receipt for the money, he felt that this favour, demanding a"
"return, was hardly worth having.  My master, however, did not"
care to make an outward gift which would leave an inward
"obligation.  To destroy self-respect is to destroy caste, was his"
idea.

"After signing the note, Panchu s obeisance to my master fell off"
considerably in its reverence--the dust-taking was left out.  It
made my master smile; he asked nothing better than that courtesy
should stoop less low.   Respect given and taken truly balances
"the account between man and man,  was the way he put it,  but"
veneration is overpayment. 

Panchu began to buy cloth at the market and peddle it about the
"village.  He did not get much of cash payment, it is true, but"
"what he could realize in kind, in the way of rice, jute, and"
"other field produce, went towards settlement of his account.  In"
two month s time he was able to pay back an instalment of my
"master s debt, and with it there was a corresponding reduction in"
the depth of his bow.  He must have begun to feel that he had
"been revering as a saint a mere man, who had not even risen"
superior to the lure of lucre.

"While Panchu was thus engaged, the full shock of the"
  Swadeshi   flood fell on him.

"It was vacation time, and many youths of our village and its"
neighbourhood had come home from their schools and colleges.
"They attached themselves to Sandip s leadership with enthusiasm,"
"and some, in their excess of zeal, gave up their studies"
altogether.  Many of the boys had been free pupils of my school
"here, and some held college scholarships from me in Calcutta."
"They came up in a body, and demanded that I should banish foreign"
goods from my Suksar market.

I told them I could not do it.

"They were sarcastic:  Why, Maharaja, will the loss be too much"
for you? 

"I took no notice of the insult in their tone, and was about to"
reply that the loss would fall on the poor traders and their
"customers, not on me, when my master, who was present,"
interposed.

" Yes, the loss will be his--not yours, that is clear enough,  he"
said.

 But for one s country .  . 

" The country does not mean the soil, but the men on it, "
interrupted my master again.   Have you yet wasted so much as a
glance on what was happening to them?  But now you would dictate
"what salt they shall eat, what clothes they shall wear.  Why"
"should they put up with such tyranny, and why should we let"
them? 

 But we have taken to Indian salt and sugar and cloth ourselves. 

" You may do as you please to work off your irritation, to keep up"
"your fanaticism.  You are well off, you need not mind the cost."
"The poor do not want to stand in your way, but you insist on"
"their submitting to your compulsion.  As it is, every moment of"
theirs is a life-and-death struggle for a bare living; you cannot
even imagine the difference a few pice means to them--so little
have you in common.  You have spent your whole past in a superior
"compartment, and now you come down to use them as tools for the"
wreaking of your wrath.  I call it cowardly. 

"They were all old pupils of my master, so they did not venture to"
"be disrespectful, though they were quivering with indignation."
"They turned to me.   Will you then be the only one, Maharaja, to"
put obstacles in the way of what the country would achieve? 

" Who am I, that I should dare do such a thing?  Would I not"
rather lay down my life to help it? 

"The M.A.  student smiled a crooked smile, as he asked:  May we"
enquire what you are actually doing to help? 

 I have imported Indian mill-made yarn and kept it for sale in my
"Suksar market, and also sent bales of it to markets belonging to"
neighbouring   zamindars  . 

" But we have been to your market, Maharaja,  the same student"
"exclaimed,  and found nobody buying this yarn. "

 That is neither my fault nor the fault of my market.  It only
shows the whole country has not taken your vow. 

" That is not all,  my master went on.   It shows that what you"
have pledged yourselves to do is only to pester others.  You want
"dealers, who have not taken your vow, to buy that yarn; weavers,"
"who have not taken your vow, to make it up; then their wares"
"eventually to be foisted on to consumers who, also, have not"
"taken your vow.  The method?  Your clamour, and the"
  zamindars    oppression.  The result: all righteousness
"yours, all privations theirs! "

" And may we venture to ask, further, what your share of the"
privation has been?   pursued a science student.

" You want to know, do you?   replied my master.   It is Nikhil"
himself who has to buy up that Indian mill yarn; he has had to
start a weaving school to get it woven; and to judge by his past
"brilliant business exploits, by the time his cotton fabrics leave"
the loom their cost will be that of cloth-of-gold; so they will
"only find a use, perhaps, as curtains for his drawing-room, even"
though their flimsiness may fail to screen him.  When you get
"tired of your vow, you will laugh the loudest at their artistic"
effect.  And if their workmanship is ever truly appreciated at
"all, it will be by foreigners. "

"I have known my master all my life, but have never seen him so"
agitated.  I could see that the pain had been silently
"accumulating in his heart for some time, because of his"
"surpassing love for me, and that his habitual self-possession had"
become secretly undermined to the breaking point.

" You are our elders,  said the medical student.   It is unseemly"
"that we should bandy words with you.  But tell us, pray, finally,"
are you determined not to oust foreign articles from your
market? 

" I will not,  I said,  because they are not mine. "

 Because that will cause you a loss!   smiled the M.A.  student.

" Because he, whose is the loss, is the best judge,  retorted my"
master.

With a shout of   Bande Mataram   they left us.



Chapter Six

Nikhil s Story

VIII



"A FEW days later, my master brought Panchu round to me.  His"
"  zamindar  , it appeared, had fined him a hundred rupees, and"
was threatening him with ejectment.

 For what fault?   I enquired.

" Because,  I was told,  he has been found selling foreign cloths."
"He begged and prayed Harish Kundu, his   zamindar  , to let"
"him sell off his stock, bought with borrowed money, promising"
faithfully never to do it again; but the   zamindar   would
"not hear of it, and insisted on his burning the foreign stuff"
"there and then, if he wanted to be let off.  Panchu in his"
desperation blurted out defiantly:  I can t afford it!  You are
rich; why not buy it up and burn it?   This only made Harish
Kundu red in the face as he shouted:  The scoundrel must be
"taught manners, give him a shoe-beating!   So poor Panchu got"
insulted as well as fined.

 What happened to the cloth? 

 The whole bale was burnt. 

 Who else was there? 

" Any number of people, who all kept shouting   Bande"
Mataram  .  Sandip was also there.  He took up some of the
"ashes, crying:  Brothers!  This is the first funeral pyre lighted"
by your village in celebration of the last rites of foreign
commerce.  These are sacred ashes.  Smear yourselves with them in
token of your   Swadeshi   vow.  

" Panchu,  said I, turning to him,  you must lodge a complaint. "

" No one will bear me witness,  he replied."

 None bear witness?--Sandip!  Sandip! 

Sandip came out of his room at my call.   What is the matter? 
he asked.

 Won t you bear witness to the burning of this man s cloth? 

"Sandip smiled.   Of course I shall be a witness in the case,  he"
said.   But I shall be on the opposite side. 

" What do you mean,  I exclaimed,  by being a witness on this or"
that side?  Will you not bear witness to the truth? 

 Is the thing which happens the only truth? 

 What other truths can there be? 

 The things that ought to happen!  The truth we must build up
will require a great deal of untruth in the process.  Those who
"have made their way in the world have created truth, not blindly"
followed it. 

 And so-- 

 And so I will bear what you people are pleased to call false
"witness, as they have done who have created empires, built up"
"social systems, founded religious organizations.  Those who would"
rule do not dread untruths; the shackles of truth are reserved
for those who will fall under their sway.  Have you not read
"history?  Do you not know that in the immense cauldrons, where"
"vast political developments are simmering, untruths are the main"
ingredients? 

" Political cookery on a large scale is doubtless going on, but-- "

" Oh, I know!  You, of course, will never do any of the cooking."
You prefer to be one of those down whose throats the hotchpotch
which is being cooked will be crammed.  They will partition
Bengal and say it is for your benefit.  They will seal the doors
of education and call it raising the standard.  But you will
"always remain good boys, snivelling in your corners.  We bad men,"
"however, must see whether we cannot erect a defensive"
fortification of untruth. 

" It is no use arguing about these things, Nikhil,  my master"
"interposed.   How can they who do not feel the truth within them,"
realize that to bring it out from its obscurity into the light is
man s highest aim--not to keep on heaping material outside? 

"Sandip laughed.   Right, sir!   said he.   Quite a correct speech"
for a schoolmaster.  That is the kind of stuff I have read in
books; but in the real world I have seen that man s chief
business is the accumulation of outside material.  Those who are
"masters in the art, advertise the biggest lies in their business,"
enter false accounts in their political ledgers with their
"broadest-pointed pens, launch their newspapers daily laden with"
"untruths, and send preachers abroad to disseminate falsehood like"
flies carrying pestilential germs.  I am a humble follower of
these great ones.  When I was attached to the Congress party I
never hesitated to dilute ten per cent of truth with ninety per
"cent of untruth.  And now, merely because I have ceased to belong"
"to that party, I have not forgotten the basic fact that man s"
goal is not truth but success. 

" True success,  corrected my master."

" Maybe,  replied Sandip,  but the fruit of true success ripens"
"only by cultivating the field of untruth, after tearing up the"
soil and pounding it into dust.  Truth grows up by itself like
"weeds and thorns, and only worms can expect to get fruit from"
it!   With this he flung out of the room.

"My master smiled as he looked towards me.   Do you know, Nikhil, "
"he said,  I believe Sandip is not irreligious--his religion is of"
"the obverse side of truth, like the dark moon, which is still a"
"moon, for all that its light has gone over to the wrong side. "

" That is why,  I assented,  I have always had an affection for"
"him, though we have never been able to agree.  I cannot contemn"
"him, even now; though he has hurt me sorely, and may yet hurt me"
more. 

" I have begun to realize that,  said my master.   I have long"
"wondered how you could go on putting up with him.  I have, at"
"times, even suspected you of weakness.  I now see that though you"
"two do not rhyme, your rhythm is the same. "

" Fate seems bent on writing   Paradise Lost   in blank verse,"
"in my case, and so has no use for a rhyming friend!   I remarked,"
pursuing his conceit.

 But what of Panchu?   resumed my master.

 You say Harish Kundu wants to eject him from his ancestral
holding.  Supposing I buy it up and then keep him on as my
tenant? 

 And his fine? 

 How can the   zamindar   realize that if he becomes my
tenant? 

 His burnt bale of cloth? 

 I will procure him another.  I should like to see anyone
"interfering with a tenant of mine, for trading as he pleases! "

" I am afraid, sir,  interposed Panchu despondently,  while you"
"big folk are doing the fighting, the police and the law vultures"
"will merrily gather round, and the crowd will enjoy the fun, but"
"when it comes to getting killed, it will be the turn of only poor"
me! 

" Why, what harm can come to you? "

" They will burn down my house, sir, children and all! "

" Very well, I will take charge of your children,  said my master."
 You may go on with any trade you like.  They shan t touch you. 

That very day I bought up Panchu s holding and entered into
formal possession.  Then the trouble began.

Panchu had inherited the holding of his grandfather as his sole
surviving heir.  Everybody knew this.  But at this juncture an
"aunt turned up from somewhere, with her boxes and bundles, her"
"rosary, and a widowed niece.  She ensconced herself in Panchu s"
home and laid claim to a life interest in all he had.

"Panchu was dumbfounded.   My aunt died long ago,  he protested."

In reply he was told that he was thinking of his uncle s first
"wife, but that the former had lost no time in taking to himself a"
second.

" But my uncle died before my aunt,  exclaimed Panchu, still more"
mystified.   Where was the time for him to marry again? 

This was not denied.  But Panchu was reminded that it had never
been asserted that the second wife had come after the death of
"the first, but the former had been married by his uncle during"
the latter s lifetime.  Not relishing the idea of living with a
co-wife she had remained in her father s house till her husband s
"death, after which she had got religion and retired to holy"
"Brindaban, whence she was now coming.  These facts were well"
"known to the officers of Harish Kundu, as well as to some of his"
tenants.  And if the   zamindar s   summons should be
"peremptory enough, even some of those who had partaken of the"
marriage feast would be forthcoming!

IX



"One afternoon, when I happened to be specially busy, word came to"
my office room that Bimala had sent for me.  I was startled.

 Who did you say had sent for me?   I asked the messenger.

 The Rani Mother. 

 The Bara Rani? 

" No, sir, the Chota Rani Mother. "

The Chota Rani!  It seemed a century since I had been sent for by
"her.  I kept them all waiting there, and went off into the inner"
apartments.  When I stepped into our room I had another shock of
surprise to find Bimala there with a distinct suggestion of being
"dressed up.  The room, which from persistent neglect had latterly"
"acquired an air of having grown absent-minded, had regained"
something of its old order this afternoon.  I stood there
"silently, looking enquiringly at Bimala."

She flushed a little and the fingers of her right hand toyed for
a time with the bangles on her left arm.  Then she abruptly broke
the silence.   Look here!  Is it right that ours should be the
only market in all Bengal which allows foreign goods? 

" What, then, would be the right thing to do?   I asked."

 Order them to be cleared out! 

 But the goods are not mine. 

 Is not the market yours? 

 It is much more theirs who use it for trade. 

" Let them trade in Indian goods, then. "

 Nothing would please me better.  But suppose they do not? 

 Nonsense!  How dare they be so insolent?  Are you not ... 

 I am very busy this afternoon and cannot stop to argue it out.
But I must refuse to tyrannize. 

" It would not be tyranny for selfish gain, but for the sake of"
the country. 

 To tyrannize for the country is to tyrannize over the country.
But that I am afraid you will never understand.   With this I
came away.

All of a sudden the world shone out for me with a fresh
"clearness.  I seemed to feel it in my blood, that the Earth had"
"lost the weight of its earthiness, and its daily task of"
"sustaining life no longer appeared a burden, as with a wonderful"
access of power it whirled through space telling its beads of
"days and nights.  What endless work, and withal what illimitable"
"energy of freedom!  None shall check it, oh, none can ever check"
"it!  From the depths of my being an uprush of joy, like a"
"waterspout, sprang high to storm the skies."

I repeatedly asked myself the meaning of this outburst of
feeling.  At first there was no intelligible answer.  Then it
became clear that the bond against which I had been fretting
"inwardly, night and day, had broken.  To my surprise I discovered"
that my mind was freed from all mistiness.  I could see
everything relating to Bimala as if vividly pictured on a camera
screen.  It was palpable that she had specially dressed herself
"up to coax that order out of me.  Till that moment, I had never"
viewed Bimala s adornment as a thing apart from herself.  But
"today the elaborate manner in which she had done up her hair, in"
"the English fashion, made it appear a mere decoration.  That"
"which before had the mystery of her personality about it, and was"
"priceless to me, was now out to sell itself cheap."

"As I came away from that broken cage of a bedroom, out into the"
"golden sunlight of the open, there was the avenue of bauhinias,"
"along the gravelled path in front of my verandah, suffusing the"
sky with a rosy flush.  A group of starlings beneath the trees
were noisily chattering away.  In the distance an empty bullock
"cart, with its nose on the ground, held up its tail aloft--one of"
"its unharnessed bullocks grazing, the other resting on the grass,"
"its eyes dropping for very comfort, while a crow on its back was"
pecking away at the insects on its body.

I seemed to have come closer to the heartbeats of the great earth
in all the simplicity of its daily life; its warm breath fell on
"me with the perfume of the bauhinia blossoms; and an anthem,"
"inexpressibly sweet, seemed to peal forth from this world, where"
"I, in my freedom, live in the freedom of all else."

"We, men, are knights whose quest is that freedom to which our"
ideals call us.  She who makes for us the banner under which we
fare forth is the true Woman for us.  We must tear away the
"disguise of her who weaves our net of enchantment at home, and"
know her for what she is.  We must beware of clothing her in the
"witchery of our own longings and imaginings, and thus allow her"
to distract us from our true quest.

Today I feel that I shall win through.  I have come to the
gateway of the simple; I am now content to see things as they
are.  I have gained freedom myself; I shall allow freedom to
others.  In my work will be my salvation.

"I know that, time and again, my heart will ache, but now that I"
"understand its pain in all its truth, I can disregard it.  Now"
"that I know it concerns only me, what after all can be its value?"
The suffering which belongs to all mankind shall be my crown.

"Save me, Truth!  Never again let me hanker after the false"
"paradise of Illusion.  If I must walk alone, let me at least"
tread your path.  Let the drum-beats of Truth lead me to Victory.



Sandip s Story

VII



"Bimala sent for me that day, but for a time she could not utter a"
word; her eyes kept brimming up to the verge of overflowing.  I
could see at once that she had been unsuccessful with Nikhil.
She had been so proudly confident that she would have her own
way--but I had never shared her confidence.  Woman knows man well
"enough where he is weak, but she is quite unable to fathom him"
where he is strong.  The fact is that man is as much a mystery to
"woman as woman is to man.  If that were not so, the separation of"
the sexes would only have been a waste of Nature s energy.

"Ah pride, pride!  The trouble was, not that the necessary thing"
"had failed of accomplishment, but that the entreaty, which had"
"cost her such a struggle to make, should have been refused.  What"
"a wealth of colour and movement, suggestion and deception, group"
themselves round this  me  and  mine  in woman.  That is just
where her beauty lies--she is ever so much more personal than
"man.  When man was being made, the Creator was a schoolmaster--"
His bag full of commandments and principles; but when He came to
"woman, He resigned His headmastership and turned artist, with"
only His brush and paint-box.

"When Bimala stood silently there, flushed and tearful in her"
"broken pride, like a storm-cloud, laden with rain and charged"
"with lightning, lowering over the horizon, she looked so"
absolutely sweet that I had to go right up to her and take her
"by the hand.  It was trembling, but she did not snatch it away."

" Bee,  said I,  we two are colleagues, for our aims are one."
Let us sit down and talk it over. 

"I led her, unresisting, to a seat.  But strange!  at that very"
point the rush of my impetuosity suffered an unaccountable check
#NAME?
"irresistible course, all of a sudden gets turned away from the"
bank it is crumbling by some trifling obstacle beneath the
"surface.  When I pressed Bimala s hand my nerves rang music, like"
tuned-up strings; but the symphony stopped short at the first
movement.

What stood in the way?  Nothing singly; it was a tangle of a
"multitude of things--nothing definitely palpable, but only that"
"unaccountable sense of obstruction.  Anyhow, this much has become"
"plain to me, that I cannot swear to what I really am.  It is"
because I am such a mystery to my own mind that my attraction for
myself is so strong!  If once the whole of myself should become
"known to me, I would then fling it all away--and reach beatitude!"

"As she sat down, Bimala went ashy pale.  She, too, must have"
"realized what a crisis had come and gone, leaving her unscathed."
"The comet had passed by, but the brush of its burning tail had"
overcome her.  To help her to recover herself I said:  Obstacles
"there will be, but let us fight them through, and not be down-"
"hearted.  Is not that best, Queen? "

"Bimala cleared her throat with a little cough, but simply to"
murmur:  Yes. 

" Let us sketch out our plan of action,  I continued, as I drew a"
piece of paper and a pencil from my pocket.

I began to make a list of the workers who had joined us from
Calcutta and to assign their duties to each.  Bimala interrupted
"me before I was through, saying wearily:  Leave it now; I will"
join you again this evening  and then she hurried out of the
room.  It was evident she was not in a state to attend to
anything.  She must be alone with herself for a while--perhaps
lie down on her bed and have a good cry!

"When she left me, my intoxication began to deepen, as the cloud"
colours grow richer after the sun is down.  I felt I had let the
moment of moments slip by.  What an awful coward I had been!  She
must have left me in sheer disgust at my qualms--and she was
right!

"While I was tingling all over with these reflections, a servant"
"came in and announced Amulya, one of our boys.  I felt like"
"sending him away for the time, but he stepped in before I could"
make up my mind.  Then we fell to discussing the news of the
fights which were raging in different quarters over cloth and
sugar and salt; and the air was soon clear of all fumes of
intoxication.  I felt as if awakened from a dream.  I leapt to my
feet feeling quite ready for the fray--Bande Mataram!

The news was various.  Most of the traders who were tenants of
Harish Kundu had come over to us.  Many of Nikhil s officials
"were also secretly on our side, pulling the wires in our"
interest.  The Marwari shopkeepers were offering to pay a
"penalty, if only allowed to clear their present stocks.  Only"
some Mahomedan traders were still obdurate.

One of them was taking home some German-made shawls for his
family.  These were confiscated and burnt by one of our village
boys.  This had given rise to trouble.  We offered to buy him
Indian woollen stuffs in their place.  But where were cheap
Indian woollens to be had?  We could not very well indulge him in
"Cashmere shawls!  He came and complained to Nikhil, who advised"
him to go to law.  Of course Nikhil s men saw to it that the
"trial should come to nothing, even his law-agent being on our"
side!

"The point is, if we have to replace burnt foreign clothes with"
"Indian cloth every time, and on the top of that fight through a"
"law-suit, where is the money to come from?  And the beauty of it"
is that this destruction of foreign goods is increasing their
demand and sending up the foreigner s profits--very like what
happened to the fortunate shopkeeper whose chandeliers the nabob
"delighted in smashing, tickled by the tinkle of the breaking"
glass.

The next problem is--since there is no such thing as cheap and
"gaudy Indian woollen stuff, should we be rigorous in our boycott"
"of foreign flannels and memos, or make an exception in their"
favour?

" Look here!   said I at length on the first point,  we are not"
going to keep on making presents of Indian stuff to those who
have got their foreign purchases confiscated.  The penalty is
"intended to fall on them, not on us.  If they go to law, we must"
"retaliate by burning down their granaries!--What startles you,"
Amulya?  It is not the prospect of a grand illumination that
"delights me!  You must remember, this is War.  If you are afraid"
"of causing suffering, go in for love-making, you will never do"
for this work! 

The second problem I solved by deciding to allow no compromise
"with foreign articles, in any circumstance whatever.  In the good"
"old days, when these gaily coloured foreign shawls were unknown,"
our peasantry used to manage well enough with plain cotton
quilts--they must learn to do so again.  They may not look as
"gorgeous, but this is not the time to think of looks."

Most of the boatmen had been won over to refuse to carry foreign
"goods, but the chief of them, Mirjan, was still insubordinate."

 Could you not get his boat sunk?   I asked our manager here.

" Nothing easier, sir,  he replied.   But what if afterwards I am"
held responsible? 

 Why be so clumsy as to leave any loophole for responsibility?
"However, if there must be any, my shoulders will be there to bear"
it. 

Mirjan s boat was tied near the landing-place after its freight
"had been taken over to the market-place.  There was no one on it,"
for the manager had arranged for some entertainment to which all
"had been invited.  After dusk the boat, loaded with rubbish, was"
holed and set adrift.  It sank in mid-stream.

Mirjan understood the whole thing.  He came to me in tears to beg
"for mercy.   I was wrong, sir--  he began."

 What makes you realize that all of a sudden?   I sneered.

He made no direct reply.   The boat was worth two thousand
"rupees,  he said.   I now see my mistake, and if excused this"
time I will never ...   with which he threw himself at my feet.

I asked him to come ten days later.  If only we could pay him
"that two thousand rupees at once, we could buy him up body and"
soul.  This is just the sort of man who could render us immense
"service, if won over.  We shall never be able to make any headway"
unless we can lay our hands on plenty of money.

"As soon as Bimala came into the sitting-room, in the evening, I"
"said as I rose up to receive her:  Queen!  Everything is ready,"
"success is at hand, but we must have money."

 Money?  How much money? 

" Not so very much, but by hook or by crook we must have it! "

 But how much? 

 A mere fifty thousand rupees will do for the present. 

"Bimala blenched inwardly at the figure, but tried not to show it."
How could she again admit defeat?

" Queen!   said I,  you only can make the impossible possible."
"Indeed you have already done so.  Oh, that I could show you the"
extent of your achievement--then you would know it.  But the time
for that is not now.  Now we want money! 

" You shall have it,  she said."

I could see that the thought of selling her jewels had occurred
to her.  So I said:  Your jewels must remain in reserve.  One can
"never tell when they may be wanted.   And then, as Bimala stared"
"blankly at me in silence, I went on:  This money must come from"
your husband s treasury. 

Bimala was still more taken aback.  After a long pause she said:
 But how am Ito get his money? 

 Is not his money yours as well? 

" Ah, no!   she said, her wounded pride hurt afresh."

" If not,  I cried,  neither is it his, but his country s, whom he"
"has deprived of it, in her time of need! "

 But how am Ito get it?   she repeated.

 Get it you shall and must.  You know best how.  You must get it
for Her to whom it rightfully belongs.    Bande Mataram  !
These are the magic words which will open the door of his iron
"safe, break through the walls of his strong-room, and confound"
the hearts of those who are disloyal to its call.  Say   Bande
"Mataram  , Bee! "

   Bande Mataram  ! 



Chapter Seven

Sandip s Story

VIII



"WE are men, we are kings, we must have our tribute.  Ever since"
we have come upon the Earth we have been plundering her; and the
"more we claimed, the more she submitted.  From primeval days have"
"we men been plucking fruits, cutting down trees, digging up the"
"soil, killing beast, bird and fish.  From the bottom of the sea,"
"from underneath the ground, from the very jaws of death, it has"
all been grabbing and grabbing and grabbing--no strong-box in
Nature s store-room has been respected or left unrifled.  The one
delight of this Earth is to fulfil the claims of those who are
men.  She has been made fertile and beautiful and complete
"through her endless sacrifices to them.  But for this, she would"
"be lost in the wilderness, not knowing herself, the doors of her"
"heart shut, her diamonds and pearls never seeing the light."

"Likewise, by sheer force of our claims, we men have opened up all"
the latent possibilities of women.  In the process of
"surrendering themselves to us, they have ever gained their true"
greatness.  Because they had to bring all the diamonds of their
"happiness and the pearls of their sorrow into our royal treasury,"
they have found their true wealth.  So for men to accept is truly
to give: for women to give is truly to gain.

"The demand I have just made from Bimala, however, is indeed a"
large one!  At first I felt scruples; for is it not the habit of
man s mind to be in purposeless conflict with itself?  I thought
I had imposed too hard a task.  My first impulse was to call her
"back, and tell her I would rather not make her life wretched by"
"dragging her into all these troubles.  I forgot, for the moment,"
"that it was the mission of man to be aggressive, to make woman s"
existence fruitful by stirring up disquiet in the depth of her
"passivity, to make the whole world blessed by churning up the"
immeasurable abyss of suffering!  This is why man s hands are so
"strong, his grip so firm.  Bimala had been longing with all her"
"heart that I, Sandip, should demand of her some great sacrifice--"
should call her to her death.  How else could she be happy?  Had
she not waited all these weary years only for an opportunity to
weep out her heart--so satiated was she with the monotony of her
"placid happiness?  And therefore, at the very sight of me, her"
heart s horizon darkened with the rain clouds of her impending
"days of anguish.  If I pity her and save her from her sorrows,"
what then was the purpose of my being born a man?

The real reason of my qualms is that my demand happens to be for
"money.  That savours of beggary, for money is man s, not woman s."
That is why I had to make it a big figure.  A thousand or two
would have the air of petty theft.  Fifty thousand has all the
"expanse of romantic brigandage.  Ah, but riches should really"
"have been mine!  So many of my desires have had to halt, again"
"and again, on the road to accomplishment simply for want of"
"money.  This does not become me!  Had my fate been merely unjust,"
it could be forgiven--but its bad taste is unpardonable.  It is
not simply a hardship that a man like me should be at his wit s
"end to pay his house rent, or should have to carefully count out"
the coins for an Intermediate Class railway ticket--it is vulgar!

It is equally clear that Nikhil s paternal estates are a
superfluity to him.  For him it would not have been at all
unbecoming to be poor.  He would have cheerfully pulled in the
double harness of indigent mediocrity with that precious master
"of his.  I should love to have, just for once, the chance to"
fling about fifty thousand rupees in the service of my country
"and to the satisfaction of myself.  I am a nabob born, and it is"
"a great dream of mine to get rid of this disguise of poverty,"
"though it be for a day only, and to see myself in my true"
"character.  I have grave misgivings, however, as to Bimala ever"
"getting that fifty thousand rupees within her reach, and it will"
probably be only a thousand or two which will actually come to
"hand.  Be it so.  The wise man is content with half a loaf, or"
"any fraction for that matter, rather than no bread.  I must"
return to these personal reflections of mine later.  News comes
that I am wanted at once.  Something has gone wrong ...

It seems that the police have got a clue to the man who sank
Mirjan s boat for us.  He was an old offender.  They are on his
"trail, but he should be too practised a hand to be caught"
"blabbing.  However, one never knows.  Nikhil s back is up, and"
his manager may not be able to have things his own way.

" If I get into trouble, sir,  said the manager when I saw him,  I"
shall have to drag you in! 

 Where is the noose with which you can catch me?   I asked.

" I have a letter of yours, and several of Amulya Babu s.   I"
could not see that the letter marked  urgent  to which I had been
hurried into writing a reply was wanted urgently for this purpose
only!  I am getting to learn quite a number of things.

"The point now is, that the police must be bribed and hush-money"
paid to Mirjan for his boat.  It is also becoming evident that
much of the cost of this patriotic venture of ours will find its
"way as profit into the pockets of Nikhil s manager.  However, I"
"must shut my eyes to that for the present, for is he not shouting"
  Bande Mataram   as lustily as I am?

This kind of work has always to be carried on with leaky vessels
which let as much through as they fetch in.  We all have a hidden
"fund of moral judgement stored away within us, and so I was about"
"to wax indignant with the manager, and enter in my diary a tirade"
"against the unreliability of our countrymen.  But, if there be a"
"god, I must acknowledge with gratitude to him that he has given"
"me a clear-seeing mind, which allows nothing inside or outside it"
"to remain vague.  I may delude others, but never myself.  So I"
was unable to continue angry.

"Whatever is true is neither good nor bad, but simply true, and"
that is Science.  A lake is only the remnant of water which has
not been sucked into the ground.  Underneath the cult of   Bande
"Mataram  , as indeed at the bottom of all mundane affairs,"
"there is a region of slime, whose absorbing power must be"
reckoned with.  The manager will take what he wants; I also have
my own wants.  These lesser wants form a part of the wants of the
great Cause--the horse must be fed and the wheels must be oiled
if the best progress is to be made.

"The long and short of it is that money we must have, and that"
"soon.  We must take whatever comes the readiest, for we cannot"
afford to wait.  I know that the immediate often swallows up the
ultimate; that the five thousand rupees of today may nip in the
bud the fifty thousand rupees of tomorrow.  But I must accept the
penalty.  Have I not often twitted Nikhil that they who walk in
the paths of restraint have never known what sacrifice is?  It is
we greedy folk who have to sacrifice our greed at every step!

"Of the cardinal sins of man, Desire is for men who are men--but"
"Delusion, which is only for cowards, hampers them.  Because"
"delusion keeps them wrapped up in past and future, but is the"
very deuce for confounding their footsteps in the present.  Those
"who are always straining their ears for the call of the remote,"
"to the neglect of the call of the imminent, are like Sakuntala"
[19] absorbed in the memories of her lover.  The guest comes
"unheeded, and the curse descends, depriving them of the very"
object of their desire.

"The other day I pressed Bimala s hand, and that touch still stirs"
"her mind, as it vibrates in mine.  Its thrill must not be"
"deadened by repetition, for then what is now music will descend"
to mere argument.  There is at present no room in her mind for
"the question  why?   So I must not deprive Bimala, who is one of"
"those creatures for whom illusion is necessary, of her full"
supply of it.

"As for me, I have so much else to do that I shall have to be"
content for the present with the foam of the wine cup of passion.
"O man of desire!  Curb your greed, and practise your hand on the"
harp of illusion till you can bring out all the delicate nuances
of suggestion.  This is not the time to drain the cup to the
dregs.

------

"19. Sakuntala, after the king, her lover, went back to his"
"kingdom, promising to send for her, was so lost in thoughts of"
"him, that she failed to hear the call of her hermit guest who"
"thereupon cursed her, saying that the object of her love would"
forget all about her.  [Trans.].

Our work proceeds apace.  But though we have shouted ourselves
"hoarse, proclaiming the Mussulmans to be our brethren, we have"
come to realize that we shall never be able to bring them wholly
round to our side.  So they must be suppressed altogether and
made to understand that we are the masters.  They are now showing
"their teeth, but one day they shall dance like tame bears to the"
tune we play.

" If the idea of a United India is a true one,  objects Nikhil,"
 Mussulmans are a necessary part of it. 

" Quite so,  said I,  but we must know their place and keep them"
"there, otherwise they will constantly be giving trouble. "

 So you want to make trouble to prevent trouble? 

" What, then, is your plan? "

" There is only one well-known way of avoiding quarrels,  said"
Nikhil meaningly.

"I know that, like tales written by good people, Nikhil s"
discourse always ends in a moral.  The strange part of it is that
"with all his familiarity with moral precepts, he still believes"
in them!  He is an incorrigible schoolboy.  His only merit is his
sincerity.  The mischief with people like him is that they will
"not admit the finality even of death, but keep their eyes always"
fixed on a hereafter.

"I have long been nursing a plan which, if only I could carry it"
"out, would set fire to the whole country.  True patriotism will"
never be roused in our countrymen unless they can visualize the
motherland.  We must make a goddess of her.  My colleagues saw
the point at once.   Let us devise an appropriate image!   they
"exclaimed.   It will not do if you devise it,  I admonished"
them.   We must get one of the current images accepted as
representing the country--the worship of the people must flow
towards it along the deep-cut grooves of custom. 

But Nikhil s needs must argue even about this.   We must not seek
"the help of illusions,  he said to me some time ago,  for what we"
believe to be the true cause. 

" Illusions are necessary for lesser minds,  I said,  and to this"
class the greater portion of the world belongs.  That is why
divinities are set up in every country to keep up the illusions
"of the people, for men are only too well aware of their"
weakness. 

" No,  he replied.   God is necessary to clear away our illusions."
The divinities which keep them alive are false gods. 

" What of that?  If need be, even false gods must be invoked,"
"rather than let the work suffer.  Unfortunately for us, our"
"illusions are alive enough, but we do not know how to make them"
serve our purpose.  Look at the Brahmins.  In spite of our
"treating them as demi-gods, and untiringly taking the dust of"
"their feet, they are a force going to waste."

" There will always be a large class of people, given to"
"grovelling, who can never be made to do anything unless they are"
"bespattered with the dust of somebody s feet, be it on their"
heads or on their backs!  What a pity if after keeping Brahmins
saved up in our armoury for all these ages--keen and serviceable
#NAME?
our need. 

But it is impossible to drive all this into Nikhil s head.  He
has such a prejudice in favour of truth--as though there exists
such an objective reality!  How often have I tried to explain to
"him that where untruth truly exists, there it is indeed the"
"truth.  This was understood in our country in the old days, and"
so they had the courage to declare that for those of little
"understanding untruth is the truth.  For them, who can truly"
"believe their country to be a goddess, her image will do duty for"
the truth.  With our nature and our traditions we are unable to
"realize our country as she is, but we can easily bring ourselves"
to believe in her image.  Those who want to do real work must not
ignore this fact.

Nikhil only got excited.   Because you have lost the power of
"walking in the path of truth s attainment,  he cried,  you keep"
waiting for some miraculous boon to drop from the skies!  That is
why when your service to the country has fallen centuries into
"arrears all you can think of is, to make of it an image and"
stretch out your hands in expectation of gratuitous favours. 

" We want to perform the impossible,  I said.   So our country"
needs must be made into a god. 

" You mean you have no heart for possible tasks,  replied Nikhil."
 Whatever is already there is to be left undisturbed; yet there
must be a supernatural result: 

" Look here, Nikhil,  I said at length, thoroughly exasperated."

 The things you have been saying are good enough as moral
"lessons.  These ideas have served their purpose, as milk for"
"babes, at one stage of man s evolution, but will no longer do,"
now that man has cut his teeth.

" Do we not see before our very eyes how things, of which we never"
"even dreamt of sowing the seed, are sprouting up on every side?"
By what power?  That of the deity in our country who is becoming
manifest.  It is for the genius of the age to give that deity its
"image.  Genius does not argue, it creates.  I only give form to"
what the country imagines.

 I will spread it abroad that the goddess has vouchsafed me a
dream.  I will tell the Brahmins that they have been appointed
"her priests, and that their downfall has been due to their"
dereliction of duty in not seeing to the proper performance of
"her worship.  Do you say I shall be uttering lies?  No, say I, it"
"is the truth--nay more, the truth which the country has so long"
been waiting to learn from my lips.  If only I could get the
"opportunity to deliver my message, you would see the stupendous"
result. 

" What I am afraid of,  said Nikhil,  is, that my lifetime is"
limited and the result you speak of is not the final result.  It
will have after-effects which may not be immediately apparent. 

" I only seek the result,  said I,  which belongs to today. "

" The result I seek,  answered Nikhil,  belongs to all time. "

Nikhil may have had his share of Bengal s greatest gift--
"imagination, but he has allowed it to be overshadowed and nearly"
killed by an exotic conscientiousness.  Just look at the worship
of Durga which Bengal has carried to such heights.  That is one
of her greatest achievements.  I can swear that Durga is a
political goddess and was conceived as the image of the
  Shakti   of patriotism in the days when Bengal was praying
to be delivered from Mussulman domination.  What other province
of India has succeeded in giving such wonderful visual expression
to the ideal of its quest?

Nothing betrayed Nikhil s loss of the divine gift of imagination
more conclusively than his reply to me.   During the Mussulman
"domination,  he said,  the Maratha and the Sikh asked for fruit"
from the arms which they themselves took up.  The Bengali
contented himself with placing weapons in the hands of his
goddess and muttering incantations to her; and as his country did
not really happen to be a goddess the only fruit he got was the
lopped-off heads of the goats and buffaloes of the sacrifice.
The day that we seek the good of the country along the path of
"righteousness, He who is greater than our country will grant us"
true fruition. 

The unfortunate part of it is that Nikhil s words sound so fine
"when put down on paper.  My words, however, are not meant to be"
"scribbled on paper, but to be scored into the heart of the"
country.  The Pandit records his Treatise on Agriculture in
printer s ink; but the cultivator at the point of his plough
impresses his endeavour deep in the soil.

When I next saw Bimala I pitched my key high without further ado.
" Have we been able,  I began,  to believe with all our heart in"
the god for whose worship we have been born all these millions of
"years, until he actually made himself visible to us?"

" How often have I told you,  I continued,  that had I not seen"
you I never would have known all my country as One.  I know not
yet whether you rightly understand me.  The gods are invisible
only in their heaven--on earth they show themselves to mortal
men. 

Bimala looked at me in a strange kind of way as she gravely
"replied:  Indeed I understand you, Sandip.   This was the first"
time she called me plain Sandip.

" Krishna,  I continued,  whom Arjuna ordinarily knew only as the"
"driver of his chariot, had also His universal aspect, of which,"
"too, Arjuna had a vision one day, and that day he saw the Truth."
I have seen your Universal Aspect in my country.  The Ganges and
the Brahmaputra are the chains of gold that wind round and round
your neck; in the woodland fringes on the distant banks of the
"dark waters of the river, I have seen your collyrium-darkened"
eyelashes; the changeful sheen of your   sari   moves for me
in the play of light and shade amongst the swaying shoots of
"green corn; and the blazing summer heat, which makes the whole"
"sky lie gasping like a red-tongued lion in the desert, is nothing"
but your cruel radiance.

 Since the goddess has vouchsafed her presence to her votary in
"such wonderful guise, it is for me to proclaim her worship"
"throughout our land, and then shall the country gain new life."
 Your image make we in temple after temple.  [20] But this our
people have not yet fully realized.  So I would call on them in
your name and offer for their worship an image from which none
"shall be able to withhold belief.  Oh give me this boon, this"
power. 

Bimala s eyelids drooped and she became rigid in her seat like a
figure of stone.  Had I continued she would have gone off into a
"trance.  When I ceased speaking she opened wide her eyes, and"
"murmured with fixed gaze, as though still dazed:  O Traveller in"
the path of Destruction!  Who is there that can stay your
progress?  Do I not see that none shall stand in the way of your
desires?  Kings shall lay their crowns at your feet; the wealthy
shall hasten to throw open their treasure for your acceptance;
those who have nothing else shall beg to be allowed to offer
"their lives.  O my king, my god!  What you have seen in me I know"
"not, but I have seen the immensity of your grandeur in my heart."
"Who am I, what am I, in its presence?  Ah, the awful power of"
Devastation!  Never shall I truly live till it kills me utterly!
"I can bear it no longer, my heart is breaking! "

"Bimala slid down from her seat and fell at my feet, which she"
"clasped, and then she sobbed and sobbed and sobbed."

This is hypnotism indeed--the charm which can subdue the world!
"No materials, no weapons--but just the delusion of irresistible"
suggestion.  Who says  Truth shall Triumph ?  [21] Delusion
shall win in the end.  The Bengali understood this when he
"conceived the image of the ten-handed goddess astride her lion,"
and spread her worship in the land.  Bengal must now create a new
image to enchant and conquer the world.    Bande Mataram  !

"I gently lifted Bimala back into her chair, and lest reaction"
"should set in, I began again without losing time:  Queen!  The"
Divine Mother has laid on me the duty of establishing her worship
"in the land.  But, alas, I am poor! "

"Bimala was still flushed, her eyes clouded, her accents thick, as"
she replied:  You poor?  Is not all that each one has yours?
What are my caskets full of jewellery for?  Drag away from me all
my gold and gems for your worship.  I have no use for them! 

Once before Bimala had offered up her ornaments.  I am not
"usually in the habit of drawing lines, but I felt I had to draw"
the line there.  [22] I know why I feel this hesitation.  It is
for man to give ornaments to woman; to take them from her wounds
his manliness.

But I must forget myself.  Am I taking them?  They are for the
"Divine Mother, to be poured in worship at her feet.  Oh, but it"
must be a grand ceremony of worship such as the country has never
beheld before.  It must be a landmark in our history.  It shall
be my supreme legacy to the Nation.  Ignorant men worship gods.
"I, Sandip, shall create them."

But all this is a far cry.  What about the urgent immediate?  At
least three thousand is indispensably necessary--five thousand
would do roundly and nicely.  But how on earth am I to mention
money after the high flight we have just taken?  And yet time is
precious!

I crushed all hesitation under foot as I jumped up and made my
"plunge:  Queen!  Our purse is empty, our work about to stop! "

Bimala winced.  I could see she was thinking of that impossible
fifty thousand rupees.  What a load she must have been carrying
"within her bosom, struggling under it, perhaps, through sleepless"
nights!  What else had she with which to express her loving
"worship?  Debarred from offering her heart at my feet, she"
"hankers to make this sum of money, so hopelessly large for her,"
the bearer of her imprisoned feelings.  The thought of what she
must have gone through gives me a twinge of pain; for she is now
wholly mine.  The wrench of plucking up the plant by the roots is
over.  It is now only careful tending and nurture that is needed.

" Queen!   said I,  that fifty thousand rupees is not particularly"
"wanted just now.  I calculate that, for the present, five"
thousand or even three will serve. 

The relief made her heart rebound.   I shall fetch you five
"thousand,  she said in tones which seemed like an outburst of"
song--the song which Radhika of the Vaishnava lyrics sang:

/*
  For my lover will I bind in my hair
  The flower which has no equal in the three worlds!
*/

"--it is the same tune, the same song: five thousand will I bring!"
That flower will I bind in my hair!

The narrow restraint of the flute brings out this quality of
song.  I must not allow the pressure of too much greed to flatten
"out the reed, for then, as I fear, music will give place to the"
questions  Why?    What is the use of so much?    How am I to get
"it? --not a word of which will rhyme with what Radhika sang!  So,"
"as I was saying, illusion alone is real--it is the flute itself;"
while truth is but its empty hollow.  Nikhil has of late got a
"taste of that pure emptiness--one can see it in his face, which"
pains even me.  But it was Nikhil s boast that he wanted the
"Truth, while mine was that I would never let go illusion from my"
"grasp.  Each has been suited to his taste, so why complain?"

"To keep Bimala s heart in the rarefied air of idealism, I cut"
short all further discussion over the five thousand rupees.  I
reverted to the demon-destroying goddess and her worship.  When
was the ceremony to be held and where?  There is a great annual
"fair at Ruimari, within Nikhil s estates, where hundreds of"
thousands of pilgrims assemble.  That would be a grand place to
inaugurate the worship of our goddess!

Bimala waxed intensely enthusiastic.  This was not the burning of
"foreign cloth or the people s granaries, so even Nikhil could"
have no objection--so thought she.  But I smiled inwardly.  How
"little these two persons, who have been together, day and night,"
"for nine whole years, know of each other!  They know something"
"perhaps of their home life, but when it comes to outside concerns"
they are entirely at sea.  They had cherished the belief that the
harmony of the home with the outside was perfect.  Today they
realize to their cost that it is too late to repair their neglect
"of years, and seek to harmonize them now."

What does it matter?  Let those who have made the mistake learn
their error by knocking against the world.  Why need I bother
about their plight?  For the present I find it wearisome to keep
"Bimala soaring much longer, like a captive balloon, in regions"
ethereal.  I had better get quite through with the matter in
hand.

When Bimala rose to depart and had neared the door I remarked in
"my most casual manner:  So, about the money ... "

Bimala halted and faced back as she said:  On the expiry of the
"month, when our personal allowances become due ... "

" That, I am afraid, would be much too late. "

 When do you want it then? 

 Tomorrow.

 Tomorrow you shall have it.

22. There is a world of sentiment attached to the ornaments worn
by women in Bengal.

They are not merely indicative of the love and regard of the
"giver, but the wearing of them symbolizes all that is held best"
"in wifehood--the constant solicitude for her husband s welfare,"
the successful performance of the material and spiritual duties
"of the household entrusted to her care.  When the husband dies,"
"and the responsibility for the household changes hands, then are"
all ornaments cast aside as a sign of the widow s renunciation of
worldly concerns.  At any other time the giving up of omaments is
always a sign of supreme distress and as such appeals acutely to
the sense of chivalry of any Bengali who may happen to witness it

Nikhil s Story

PARAGRAPHS and letters against me have begun to come out in the
"local papers; cartoons and lampoons are to follow, I am told."
"Jets of wit and humour are being splashed about, and the lies"
thus scattered are convulsing the whole country.  They know that
"the monopoly of mud-throwing is theirs, and the innocent passer-"
by cannot escape unsoiled.

"They are saying that the residents in my estates, from the"
"highest to the lowest, are in favour of   Swadeshi  , but they"
"dare not declare themselves, for fear of me.  The few who have"
been brave enough to defy me have felt the full rigour of my
"persecution.  I am in secret league with the police, and in"
"private communication with the magistrate, and these frantic"
efforts of mine to add a foreign title of my own earning to the
"one I have inherited, will not, it is opined, go in vain."

"On the other hand, the papers are full of praise for those"
"devoted sons of the motherland, the Kundu and the Chakravarti"
"  zamindars  .  If only, say they, the country had a few more"
"of such staunch patriots, the mills of Manchester would have, had"
to sound their own dirge to the tune of   Bande Mataram  .

"Then comes a letter in blood-red ink, giving a list of the"
traitorous   zamindars   whose treasuries have been burnt down
"because of their failing to support the Cause.  Holy Fire, it"
"goes on to say, has been aroused to its sacred function of"
purifying the country; and other agencies are also at work to see
that those who are not true sons of the motherland do cease to
encumber her lap.  The signature is an obvious   nom-de-
plume  .

I could see that this was the doing of our local students.  So I
sent for some of them and showed them the letter.

The B.A.  student gravely informed me that they also had heard
that a band of desperate patriots had been formed who would stick
at nothing in order to clear away all obstacles to the success of
  Swadeshi  .

" If,  said I,  even one of our countrymen succumbs to these"
"overbearing desperadoes, that will indeed be a defeat for the"
country! 

" We fail to follow you, Maharaja,  said the history student."
"  Our country,  I tried to explain,  has been brought to death s"
door through sheer fear--from fear of the gods down to fear of
"the police; and if you set up, in the name of freedom, the fear"
"of some other bogey, whatever it may be called; if you would"
raise your victorious standard on the cowardice of the country by
"means of downright oppression, then no true lover of the country"
can bow to your decision. 

" Is there any country, sir,  pursued the history student,  where"
submission to Government is not due to fear? 

" The freedom that exists in any country,  I replied,  may be"
measured by the extent of this reign of fear.  Where its threat
"is confined to those who would hurt or plunder, there the"
Government may claim to have freed man from the violence of man.
"But if fear is to regulate how people are to dress, where they"
"shall trade, or what they must eat, then is man s freedom of will"
"utterly ignored, and manhood destroyed at the root. "

 Is not such coercion of the individual will seen in other
countries too?   continued the history student.

 Who denies it?   I exclaimed.   But in every country man has
destroyed himself to the extent that he has permitted slavery to
flourish. 

" Does it not rather show,  interposed a Master of Arts,  that"
trading in slavery is inherent in man--a fundamental fact of his
nature? 

" Sandip Babu made the whole thing clear,  said a graduate.   He"
"gave us the example of Harish Kundu, your neighbouring"
  zamindar  .  From his estates you cannot ferret out a single
ounce of foreign salt.  Why?  Because he has always ruled with an
"iron hand.  In the case of those who are slaves by nature, the"
lack of a strong master is the greatest of all calamities. 

" Why, sir!   chimed in an undergraduate,  have you not heard of"
"the obstreperous tenant of Chakravarti, the other   zamindar  "
close by--how the law was set on him till he was reduced to utter
"destitution?  When at last he was left with nothing to eat, he"
"started out to sell his wife s silver ornaments, but no one dared"
buy them.  Then Chakravarti s manager offered him five rupees for
"the lot.  They were worth over thirty, but he had to accept or"
starve.  After taking over the bundle from him the manager coolly
said that those five rupees would be credited towards his rent!
We felt like having nothing more to do with Chakravarti or his
"manager after that, but Sandip Babu told us that if we threw over"
"all the live people, we should have only dead bodies from the"
"burning-grounds to carry on the work with!  These live men, he"
"pointed out, know what they want and how to get it--they are born"
"rulers.  Those who do not know how to desire for themselves, must"
"live in accordance with, or die by virtue of, the desires of such"
as these.  Sandip Babu contrasted them--Kundu and Chakravarti--
"with you, Maharaja.  You, he said, for all your good intentions,"
will never succeed in planting   Swadeshi   within your
territory. 

" It is my desire,  I said,  to plant something greater than"
  Swadeshi  .  I am not after dead logs but living trees--and
these will take time to grow. 

" I am afraid, sir,  sneered the history student,  that you will"
get neither log nor tree.  Sandip Babu rightly teaches that in
"order to get, you must snatch.  This is taking all of us some"
"time to learn, because it runs counter to what we were taught at"
school.  I have seen with my own eyes that when a rent-collector
of Harish Kundu s found one of the tenants with nothing which
"could be sold up to pay his rent, he was made to sell his young"
"wife!  Buyers were not wanting, and the   zamindar s   demand"
"was satisfied.  I tell you, sir, the sight of that man s distress"
"prevented my getting sleep for nights together!  But, feel it as"
"I did, this much I realized, that the man who knows how to get"
"the money he is out for, even by selling up his debtor s wife, is"
a better man than I am.  I confess it is beyond me--I am a
"weakling, my eyes fill with tears.  If anybody can save our"
country it is these Kundus and these Chakravartis and their
officials! 

"I was shocked beyond words.   If what you say be true,  I cried,"
 I clearly see that it must be the one endeavour of my life to
save the country from these same Kundus and Chakravartis and
officials.  The slavery that has entered into our very bones is
"breaking out, at this opportunity, as ghastly tyranny.  You have"
"been so used to submit to domination through fear, you have come"
to believe that to make others submit is a kind of religion.  My
"fight shall be against this weakness, this atrocious cruelty! "
"These things, which are so simple to ordinary folk, get so"
"twisted in the minds of our B.A. s and M.A. s, the only purpose"
of whose historical quibbles seems to be to torture the truth!

I am worried over Panchu s sham aunt.  It will be difficult to
"disprove her, for though witnesses of a real event may be few or"
"even wanting, innumerable proofs of a thing that has not happened"
"can always be marshalled.  The object of this move is, evidently,"
to get the sale of Panchu s holding to me set aside.  Being
"unable to find any other way out of it, I was thinking of"
allowing Panchu to hold a permanent tenure in my estates and
building him a cottage on it.  But my master would not have it.
"I should not give in to these nefarious tactics so easily, he"
"objected, and offered to attend to the matter himself."

" You, sir!   I cried, considerably surprised."

" Yes, I,  he repeated."

"I could not see, at all clearly, what my master could do to"
"counteract these legal machinations.  That evening, at the time"
"he usually came to me, he did not turn up.  On my making"
"inquiries, his servant said he had left home with a few things"
"packed in a small trunk, and some bedding, saying he would be"
back in a few days.  I thought he might have sallied forth to
"hunt for witnesses in Panchu s uncle s village.  In that case,"
"however, I was sure that his would be a hopeless quest ..."

During the day I forget myself in my work.  As the late autumn
"afternoon wears on, the colours of the sky become turbid, and so"
do the feelings of my mind.  There are many in this world whose
minds dwell in brick-built houses--they can afford to ignore the
thing called the outside.  But my mind lives under the trees in
"the open, directly receives upon itself the messages borne by the"
"free winds, and responds from the bottom of its heart to all the"
musical cadences of light and darkness.

While the day is bright and the world in the pursuit of its
"numberless tasks crowds around, then it seems as if my life wants"
nothing else.  But when the colours of the sky fade away and the
"blinds are drawn down over the windows of heaven, then my heart"
tells me that evening falls just for the purpose of shutting out
"the world, to mark the time when the darkness must be filled with"
"the One.  This is the end to which earth, sky, and waters"
"conspire, and I cannot harden myself against accepting its"
"meaning.  So when the gloaming deepens over the world, like the"
"gaze of the dark eyes of the beloved, then my whole being tells"
"me that work alone cannot be the truth of life, that work is not"
"the be-all and the end-all of man, for man is not simply a serf--"
even though the serfdom be of the True and the Good.

"Alas, Nikhil, have you for ever parted company with that self of"
"yours who used to be set free under the starlight, to plunge into"
the infinite depths of the night s darkness after the day s work
"was done?  How terribly alone is he, who misses companionship in"
the midst of the multitudinousness of life.

"The other day, when the afternoon had reached the meeting-point"
"of day and night, I had no work, nor the mind for work, nor was"
"my master there to keep me company.  With my empty, drifting"
"heart longing to anchor on to something, I traced my steps"
towards the inner gardens.  I was very fond of chrysanthemums and
"had rows of them, of all varieties, banked up in pots against one"
"of the garden walls.  When they were in flower, it looked like a"
wave of green breaking into iridescent foam.  It was some time
"since I had been to this part of the grounds, and I was beguiled"
into a cheerful expectancy at the thought of meeting my
chrysanthemums after our long separation.

"As I went in, the full moon had just peeped over the wall, her"
slanting rays leaving its foot in deep shadow.  It seemed as if
"she had come a-tiptoe from behind, and clasped the darkness over"
"the eyes, smiling mischievously.  When I came near the bank of"
"chrysanthemums, I saw a figure stretched on the grass in front."
My heart gave a sudden thud.  The figure also sat up with a start
at my footsteps.

What was to be done next?  I was wondering whether it would do to
"beat a precipitate retreat.  Bimala, also, was doubtless casting"
about for some way of escape.  But it was as awkward to go as to
"stay!  Before I could make up my mind, Bimala rose, pulled the"
"end of her   sari   over her head, and walked off towards the"
inner apartments.

This brief pause had been enough to make real to me the cruel
load of Bimala s misery.  The plaint of my own life vanished from
me in a moment.  I called out:  Bimala! 

"She started and stayed her steps, but did not turn back.  I went"
"round and stood before her.  Her face was in the shade, the"
"moonlight fell on mine.  Her eyes were downcast, her hands"
clenched.

" Bimala,  said I,  why should I seek to keep you fast in this"
closed cage of mine?  Do I not know that thus you cannot but pine
and droop? 

"She stood still, without raising her eyes or uttering a word."

" I know,  I continued,  that if I insist on keeping you shackled"
my whole life will be reduced to nothing but an iron chain.  What
pleasure can that be to me? 

She was still silent.

" So,  I concluded,  I tell you, truly, Bimala, you are free."
"Whatever I may or may not have been to you, I refuse to be your"
fetters.   With which I came away towards the outer apartments.

"No, no, it was not a generous impulse, nor indifference.  I had"
simply come to understand that never would I be free until I
could set free.  To try to keep Bimala as a garland round my
"neck, would have meant keeping a weight hanging over my heart."
"Have I not been praying with all my strength, that if happiness"
"may not be mine, let it go; if grief needs must be my lot, let it"
come; but let me not be kept in bondage.  To clutch hold of that
"which is untrue as though it were true, is only to throttle"
oneself.  May I be saved from such self-destruction.

"When I entered my room, I found my master waiting there.  My"
"agitated feelings were still heaving within me.   Freedom, sir, "
"I began unceremoniously, without greeting or inquiry,  freedom is"
the biggest thing for man.  Nothing can be compared to it--
nothing at all! 

"Surprised at my outburst, my master looked up at me in silence."

" One can understand nothing from books,  I went on.   We read in"
"the scriptures that our desires are bonds, fettering us as well"
"as others.  But such words, by themselves, are so empty.  It is"
only when we get to the point of letting the bird out of its cage
that we can realize how free the bird has set us.  Whatever we
"cage, shackles us with desire whose bonds are stronger than those"
"of iron chains.  I tell you, sir, this is just what the world has"
failed to understand.  They all seek to reform something outside
"themselves.  But reform is wanted only in one s own desires,"
"nowhere else, nowhere else! "

" We think,  he said,  that we are our own masters when we get in"
our hands the object of our desire--but we are really our own
masters only when we are able to cast out our desires from our
minds. 

" When we put all this into words, sir,  I went on,  it sounds"
"like some bald-headed injunction, but when we realize even a"
little of it we find it to be   amrita  --which the gods have
drunk and become immortal.  We cannot see Beauty till we let go
"our hold of it.  It was Buddha who conquered the world, not"
Alexander--this is untrue when stated in dry prose--oh when shall
we be able to sing it?  When shall all these most intimate truths
of the universe overflow the pages of printed books and leap out
in a sacred stream like the Ganges from the Gangotrie? 

I was suddenly reminded of my master s absence during the last
few days and of my ignorance as to its reason.  I felt somewhat
"foolish as I asked him:  And where have you been all this while,"
sir? 

" Staying with Panchu,  he replied."

 Indeed!   I exclaimed.   Have you been there all these days? 

 Yes.  I wanted to come to an understanding with the woman who
calls herself his aunt.  She could hardly be induced to believe
that there could be such an odd character among the gentlefolk as
the one who sought their hospitality.  When she found I really
"meant to stay on, she began to feel rather ashamed of herself."
" Mother,  said I,  you are not going to get rid of me, even if"
"you abuse me!  And so long as I stay, Panchu stays also.  For you"
"see, do you not, that I cannot stand by and see his motherless"
little ones sent out into the streets? 

 She listened to my talks in this strain for a couple of days
without saying yes or no.  This morning I found her tying up her
"bundles.   We are going back to Brindaban,  she said.   Let us"
have our expenses for the journey.  I knew she was not going to
"Brindaban, and also that the cost of her journey would be"
substantial.  So I have come to you. 

" The required cost shall be paid,  I said."

" The old woman is not a bad sort,  my master went on musingly."
" Panchu was not sure of her caste, and would not let her touch"
"the water-jar, or anything at all of his.  So they were"
continually bickering.  When she found I had no objection to her
"touch, she looked after me devotedly.  She is a splendid cook!"

 But all remnants of Panchu s respect for me vanished!  To the
last he had thought that I was at least a simple sort of person.
"But here was I, risking my caste without a qualm to win over the"
old woman for my purpose.  Had I tried to steal a march on her by
"tutoring a witness for the trial, that would have been a"
different matter.  Tactics must be met by tactics.  But stratagem
at the expense of orthodoxy is more than he can tolerate!

" Anyhow, I must stay on a few days at Panchu s even after the"
"woman leaves, for Harish Kundu may be up to any kind of devilry."
He has been telling his satellites that he was content to have
"furnished Panchu with an aunt, but I have gone the length of"
"supplying him with a father.  He would like to see, now, how many"
fathers of his can save him! 

" We may or may not be able to save him,  I said;  but if we"
should perish in the attempt to save the country from the
"thousand-and-one snares--of religion, custom and selfishness--"
"which these people are busy spreading, we shall at least die"
happy. 



Bimala s Story

XIV



Who could have thought that so much would happen in this one
life?  I feel as if I have passed through a whole series of
"births, time has been flying so fast, I did not feel it move at"
"all, till the shock came the other day."

I knew there would be words between us when I made up my mind to
ask my husband to banish foreign goods from our market.  But it
was my firm belief that I had no need to meet argument by
"argument, for there was magic in the very air about me.  Had not"
"so tremendous a man as Sandip fallen helplessly at my feet, like"
a wave of the mighty sea breaking on the shore?  Had I called
"him?  No, it was the summons of that magic spell of mine.  And"
"Amulya, poor dear boy, when he first came to me--how the current"
"of his life flushed with colour, like the river at dawn!  Truly"
have I realized how a goddess feels when she looks upon the
radiant face of her devotee.

"With the confidence begotten of these proofs of my power, I was"
ready to meet my husband like a lightning-charged cloud.  But
what was it that happened?  Never in all these nine years have I
"seen such a far-away, distraught look in his eyes--like the"
"desert sky--with no merciful moisture of its own, no colour"
"reflected, even, from what it looked upon.  I should have been so"
relieved if his anger had flashed out!  But I could find nothing
in him which I could touch.  I felt as unreal as a dream--a dream
which would leave only the blackness of night when it was over.

In the old days I used to be jealous of my sister-in-law for her
beauty.  Then I used to feel that Providence had given me no
"power of my own, that my whole strength lay in the love which my"
husband had bestowed on me.  Now that I had drained to the dregs
"the cup of power and could not do without its intoxication, I"
"suddenly found it dashed to pieces at my feet, leaving me nothing"
to live for.

"How feverishly I had sat to do my hair that day.  Oh, shame,"
"shame on me, the utter shame of it!  My sister-in-law, when"
"passing by, had exclaimed:  Aha, Chota Rani!  Your hair seems"
ready to jump off.  Don t let it carry your head with it. 

"And then, the other day in the garden, how easy my husband found"
it to tell me that he set me free!  But can freedom--empty
freedom--be given and taken so easily as all that?  It is like
setting a fish free in the sky--for how can I move or live
outside the atmosphere of loving care which has always sustained
me?

"When I came to my room today, I saw only furniture--only the"
"bedstead, only the looking-glass, only the clothes-rack--not the"
"all-pervading heart which used to be there, over all.  Instead of"
"it there was freedom, only freedom, mere emptiness!  A dried-up"
watercourse with all its rocks and pebbles laid bare.  No
"feeling, only furniture!"

"When I had arrived at a state of utter bewilderment, wondering"
"whether anything true was left in my life, and whereabouts it"
"could be, I happened to meet Sandip again.  Then life struck"
"against life, and the sparks flew in the same old way.  Here was"
truth--impetuous truth--which rushed in and overflowed all
"bounds, truth which was a thousand times truer than the Bara Rani"
"with her maid, Thako and her silly songs, and all the rest of"
them who talked and laughed and wandered about ...

 Fifty thousand!   Sandip had demanded.

 What is fifty thousand?   cried my intoxicated heart.   You
shall have it! 

"How to get it, where to get it, were minor points not worth"
"troubling over.  Look at me.  Had I not risen, all in one moment,"
from my nothingness to a height above everything?  So shall all
"things come at my beck and call.  I shall get it, get it, get it"
#NAME?

Thus had I come away from Sandip the other day.  Then as I looked
"about me, where was it--the tree of plenty?  Oh, why does this"
outer world insult the heart so?

"And yet get it I must; how, I do not care; for sin there cannot"
be.  Sin taints only the weak; I with my   Shakti   am beyond
"its reach.  Only a commoner can be a thief, the king conquers and"
takes his rightful spoil ...  I must find out where the treasury
is; who takes the money in; who guards it.

I spent half the night standing in the outer verandah peering at
the row of office buildings.  But how to get that fifty thousand
rupees out of the clutches of those iron bars?  If by some
  mantram   I could have made all those guards fall dead in
"their places, I would not have hesitated--so pitiless did I feel!"

But while a whole gang of robbers seemed dancing a war-dance
"within the whirling brain of its Rani, the great house of the"
Rajas slept in peace.  The gong of the watch sounded hour after
"hour, and the sky overhead placidly looked on."

At last I sent for Amulya.

" Money is wanted for the Cause,  I told him.   Can you not get it"
out of the treasury? 

" Why not?   said he, with his chest thrown out."

Alas!  had I not said  Why not?   to Sandip just in the same way?
The poor lad s confidence could rouse no hopes in my mind.

 How will you do it?   I asked.

The wild plans he began to unfold would hardly bear repetition
outside the pages of a penny dreadful.

" No, Amulya,  I said severely,  you must not be childish. "

" Very well, then,  he said,  let me bribe those watchmen. "

 Where is the money to come from? 

" I can loot the bazar,  he burst out, without blenching."

" Leave all that alone.  I have my ornaments, they will serve."

" But,  said Amulya,  it strikes me that the cashier cannot be"
"bribed.  Never mind, there is another and simpler way. "

 What is that? 

 Why need you hear it?  It is quite simple. 

" Still, I should like to know. "

"Amulya fumbled in the pocket of his tunic and pulled out, first a"
"small edition of the   Gita  , which he placed on the table--"
"and then a little pistol, which he showed me, but said nothing"
further.

Horror!  It did not take him a moment to make up his mind to kill
"our good old cashier!  [23] To look at his frank, open face one"
"would not have thought him capable of hurting a fly, but how"
different were the words which came from his mouth.  It was clear
that the cashier s place in the world meant nothing real to him;
"it was a mere vacancy, lifeless, feelingless, with only stock"
phrases from the   Gita--Who kills the body kills naught!   

" Whatever do you mean, Amulya?   I exclaimed at length.   Don t"
you know that the dear old man has got a wife and children and
that he is ... 

 Where are we to find men who have no wives and children?   he
"interrupted.   Look here, Maharani, the thing we call pity is, at"
"bottom, only pity for ourselves.  We cannot bear to wound our own"
"tender instincts, and so we do not strike at all--pity indeed!"
The height of cowardice! 

To hear Sandip s phrases in the mouth of this mere boy staggered
"me.  So delightfully, lovably immature was he--of that age when"
"the good may still be believed in as good, of that age when one"
really lives and grows.  The Mother in me awoke.

"For myself there was no longer good or bad--only death, beautiful"
alluring death.  But to hear this stripling calmly talk of
"murdering an inoffensive old man as the right thing to do, made"
me shudder all over.  The more clearly I saw that there was no
"sin in his heart, the more horrible appeared to me the sin of his"
words.  I seemed to see the sin of the parents visited on the
innocent child.

The sight of his great big eyes shining with faith and enthusiasm
"touched me to the quick.  He was going, in his fascination,"
"straight to the jaws of the python, from which, once in, there"
was no return.  How was he to be saved?  Why does not my country
"become, for once, a real Mother--clasp him to her bosom and cry"
"out:  Oh, my child, my child, what profits it that you should"
"save me, if so it be that I should fail to save you? "

"I know, I know, that all Power on earth waxes great under compact"
"with Satan.  But the Mother is there, alone though she be, to"
contemn and stand against this devil s progress.  The Mother
"cares not for mere success, however great--she wants to give"
"life, to save life.  My very soul, today, stretches out its hands"
in yearning to save this child.

A while ago I suggested robbery to him.  Whatever I may now say
against it will be put down to a woman s weakness.  They only
love our weakness when it drags the world in its toils!

" You need do nothing at all, Amulya, I will see to the money,  I"
"told him finally.  When he had almost reached the door, I called"
him back.

" Amulya,  said I,  I am your elder sister.  Today is not the"
"Brothers  Day [24] according to the calendar, but all the days in"
the year are really Brothers  Days.  My blessing be with you: may
God keep you always. 

These unexpected words from my lips took Amulya by surprise.  He
"stood stock-still for a time.  Then, coming to himself, he"
prostrated himself at my feet in acceptance of the relationship
and did me reverence.  When he rose his eyes were full of tears
...  O little brother mine!  I am fast going to my death--let me
take all your sin away with me.  May no taint from me ever
tarnish your innocence!

I said to him:  Let your offering of reverence be that pistol! 

" What do you want with it, sister? "

 I will practise death. 

" Right, sister.  Our women, also, must know how to die, to deal"
death!   with which Amulya handed me the pistol.  The radiance of
his youthful countenance seemed to tinge my life with the touch
of a new dawn.  I put away the pistol within my clothes.  May
this reverence-offering be the last resource in my extremity ...

"The door to the mother s chamber in my woman s heart once opened,"
I thought it would always remain open.  But this pathway to the
supreme good was closed when the mistress took the place of the
mother and locked it again.  The very next day I saw Sandip; and
"madness, naked and rampant, danced upon my heart."

"What was this?  Was this, then, my truer self?  Never!  I had"
"never before known this shameless, this cruel one within me.  The"
"snake-charmer had come, pretending to draw this snake from within"
"the fold of my garment--but it was never there, it was his all"
"the time.  Some demon has gained possession of me, and what I am"
doing today is the play of his activity--it has nothing to do
with me.

"This demon, in the guise of a god, had come with his ruddy torch"
"to call me that day, saying:  I am your Country.  I am your"
Sandip.  I am more to you than anything else of yours.    Bande
Mataram  !   And with folded hands I had responded:  You are my
religion.  You are my heaven.  Whatever else is mine shall be
swept away before my love for you.    Bande Mataram  ! 

Five thousand is it?  Five thousand it shall be!  You want it
"tomorrow?  Tomorrow you shall have it!  In this desperate orgy,"
that gift of five thousand shall be as the foam of wine--and then
for the riotous revel!  The immovable world shall sway under our
"feet, fire shall flash from our eyes, a storm shall roar in our"
"ears, what is or is not in front shall become equally dim.  And"
then with tottering footsteps we shall plunge to our death--in a
"moment all fire will be extinguished, the ashes will be"
"scattered, and nothing will remain behind."

"ladies of a   zamindar s   household, directly taking their"
requisitions for household stores and doing their shopping for
"them, and so he becomes more a member of the family than the"

"corresponding memories with her to her husband s home, where she"
has to begin as a stranger before she can get into her place.
"The resulting feeling, of the mistress of her new home for the"
"one she has left, has taken ceremonial form as the Brothers  Day,"
on which the brothers are invited to the married sisters  houses.
"Where the sister is the elder, she offers her blessing and"
"receives the brother s reverence, and vice versa.  Presents,"
"called the offerings of reverence (or blessing), are exchanged."

Bimala s Story

XV



FOR a time I was utterly at a loss to think of any way of getting
"that money.  Then, the other day, in the light of intense"
"excitement, suddenly the whole picture stood out clear before me."

Every year my husband makes a reverence-offering of six thousand
rupees to my sister-in-law at the time of the Durga Puja.  Every
year it is deposited in her account at the bank in Calcutta.
"This year the offering was made as usual, but it has not yet been"
"sent to the bank, being kept meanwhile in an iron safe, in a"
corner of the little dressing-room attached to our bedroom.

Every year my husband takes the money to the bank himself.  This
year he has not yet had an opportunity of going to town.  How
could I fail to see the hand of Providence in this?  The money
has been held up because the country wants it--who could have the
power to take it away from her to the bank?  And how can I have
the power to refuse to take the money?  The goddess revelling in
destruction holds out her blood-cup crying:  Give me drink.  I am
thirsty.   I will give her my own heart s blood with that five
"thousand rupees.  Mother, the loser of that money will scarcely"
"feel the loss, but me you will utterly ruin!"

"Many a time, in the old days, have I inwardly called the Senior"
"Rani a thief, for I charged her with wheedling money out of my"
"trusting husband.  After her husband s death, she often used to"
make away with things belonging to the estate for her own use.
"This I used to point out to my husband, but he remained silent."
"I would get angry and say:  If you feel generous, make gifts by"
"all means, but why allow yourself to be robbed?   Providence must"
"have smiled, then, at these complaints of mine, for tonight I am"
on the way to rob my husband s safe of my sister-in-law s money.
My husband s custom was to let his keys remain in his pockets
"when he took off his clothes for the night, leaving them in the"
dressing-room.  I picked out the key of the safe and opened it.
The slight sound it made seemed to wake the whole world!  A
"sudden chill turned my hands and feet icy cold, and I shivered"
all over.

There was a drawer inside the safe.  On opening this I found the
"money, not in currency notes, but in gold rolled up in paper.  I"
"had no time to count out what I wanted.  There were twenty rolls,"
all of which I took and tied up in a corner of my   sari  .

What a weight it was.  The burden of the theft crushed my heart
to the dust.  Perhaps notes would have made it seem less like
"thieving, but this was all gold."

"After I had stolen into my room like a thief, it felt like my own"
room no longer.  All the most precious rights which I had over it
"vanished at the touch of my theft.  I began to mutter to myself,"
"as though telling   mantrams: Bande Mataram, Bande Mataram  ,"
"my Country, my golden Country, all this gold is for you, for none"
else!

But in the night the mind is weak.  I came back into the bedroom
"where my husband was asleep, closing my eyes as I passed through,"
"and went off to the open terrace beyond, on which I lay prone,"
clasping to my breast the end of the   sari   tied over the
gold.  And each one of the rolls gave me a shock of pain.

The silent night stood there with forefinger upraised.  I could
not think of my house as separate from my country: I had robbed
"my house, I had robbed my country.  For this sin my house had"
"ceased to be mine, my country also was estranged from me.  Had I"
"died begging for my country, even unsuccessfully, that would have"
"been worship, acceptable to the gods.  But theft is never"
worship--how then can I offer this gold?  Ah me!  I am doomed to
"death myself, must I desecrate my country with my impious touch?"
The way to put the money back is closed to me.  I have not
"the strength to return to the room, take again that key, open"
once more that safe--I should swoon on the threshold of my
husband s door.  The only road left now is the road in front.
Neither have I the strength deliberately to sit down and count
the coins.  Let them remain behind their coverings: I cannot
calculate.

There was no mist in the winter sky.  The stars were shining
"brightly.  If, thought I to myself, as I lay out there, I had to"
"steal these stars one by one, like golden coins, for my country--"
these stars so carefully stored up in the bosom of the darkness--
"then the sky would be blinded, the night widowed for ever, and my"
theft would rob the whole world.  But was not also this very
"thing I had done a robbing of the whole world--not only of money,"
"but of trust, of righteousness?"

I spent the night lying on the terrace.  When at last it was
"morning, and I was sure that my husband had risen and left the"
"room, then only with my shawl pulled over my head, could I"
retrace my steps towards the bedroom.

"My sister-in-law was about, with her brass pot, watering her"
plants.  When she saw me passing in the distance she cried:  Have
"you heard the news, Chota Rani? "

"I stopped in silence, all in a tremor.  It seemed to me that the"
rolls of sovereigns were bulging through the shawl.  I feared
"they would burst and scatter in a ringing shower, exposing to all"
the servants of the house the thief who had made herself
destitute by robbing her own wealth.

" Your band of robbers,  she went on,  have sent an anonymous"
message threatening to loot the treasury. 

I remained as silent as a thief.

" I was advising Brother Nikhil to seek your protection,  she"
"continued banteringly.   Call off your minions, Robber Queen!  We"
will offer sacrifices to your   Bande Mataram   if you will
but save us.  What doings there are these days!--but for the
"Lord s sake, spare our house at least from burglary. "

I hastened into my room without reply.  I had put my foot on
"quicksand, and could not now withdraw it.  Struggling would only"
send me down deeper.

If only the time would arrive when I could hand over the money to
"Sandip!  I could bear it no longer, its weight was breaking"
through my very ribs.

It was still early when I got word that Sandip was awaiting me.
Today I had no thought of adornment.  Wrapped as I was in my
"shawl, I went off to the outer apartments.  As I entered the"
"sitting-room I saw Sandip and Amulya there, together.  All my"
"dignity, all my honour, seemed to run tingling through my body"
from head to foot and vanish into the ground.  I should have to
lay bare a woman s uttermost shame in sight of this boy!  Could
they have been discussing my deed in their meeting place?  Had
any vestige of a veil of decency been left for me?

We women shall never understand men.  When they are bent on
"making a road for some achievement, they think nothing of"
breaking the heart of the world into pieces to pave it for the
progress of their chariot.  When they are mad with the
"intoxication of creating, they rejoice in destroying the creation"
of the Creator.  This heart-breaking shame of mine will not
attract even a glance from their eyes.  They have no feeling for
life itself--all their eagerness is for their object.  What am I
to them but a meadow flower in the path of a torrent in flood?

What good will this extinction of me be to Sandip?  Only five
thousand rupees?  Was not I good for something more than only
"five thousand rupees?  Yes, indeed!  Did I not learn that from"
"Sandip himself, and was I not able in the light of this knowledge"
"to despise all else in my world?  I was the giver of light, of"
"life, of   Shakti  , of immortality--in that belief, in that"
"joy, I had burst all my bounds and come into the open.  Had"
"anyone then fulfilled for me that joy, I should have lived in my"
death.  I should have lost nothing in the loss of my all.
Do they want to tell me now that all this was false?  The psalm
"of my praise which was sung so devotedly, did it bring me down"
"from my heaven, not to make heaven of earth, but only to level"
heaven itself with the dust?



XVI


" The money, Queen?   said Sandip with his keen glance full on my"
face.

Amulya also fixed his gaze on me.  Though not my own mother s
"child, yet the dear lad is brother to me; for mother is mother"
"all the world over.  With his guileless face, his gentle eyes,"
"his innocent youth, he looked at me.  And I, a woman--of his"
"mother s sex--how could I hand him poison, just because he asked"
for it?

" The money, Queen!   Sandip s insolent demand rang in my ears."
For very shame and vexation I felt I wanted to fling that gold at
"Sandip s head.  I could hardly undo the knot of my   sari  ,"
my fingers trembled so.  At last the paper rolls dropped on the
table.

Sandip s face grew black ...  He must have thought that the rolls
were of silver ...  What contempt was in his looks.  What utter
disgust at incapacity.  It was almost as if he could have struck
"me!  He must have suspected that I had come to parley with him,"
to offer to compound his claim for five thousand rupees with a
few hundreds.  There was a moment when I thought he would snatch
"up the rolls and throw them out of the window, declaring that he"
"was no beggar, but a king claiming tribute."

 Is that all?   asked Amulya with such pity welling up in his
voice that I wanted to sob out aloud.  I kept my heart tightly
"pressed down, and merely nodded my head.  Sandip was speechless."
"He neither touched the rolls, nor uttered a sound."

"My humiliation went straight to the boy s heart.  With a sudden,"
feigned enthusiasm he exclaimed:  It s plenty.  It will do
splendidly.  You have saved us.   With which he tore open the
covering of one of the rolls.

The sovereigns shone out.  And in a moment the black covering
seemed to be lifted from Sandip s countenance also.  His delight
beamed forth from his features.  Unable to control his sudden
"revulsion of feeling, he sprang up from his seat towards me."
What he intended I know not.  I flashed a lightning glance
towards Amulya--the colour had left the boy s face as at the
stroke of a whip.  Then with all my strength I thrust Sandip from
me.  As he reeled back his head struck the edge of the marble
"table and he dropped on the floor.  There he lay awhile,"
"motionless.  Exhausted with my effort, I sank back on my seat."

Amulya s face lightened with a joyful radiance.  He did not even
"turn towards Sandip, but came straight up, took the dust of my"
"feet, and then remained there, sitting on the floor in front of"
"me.  O my little brother, my child!  This reverence of yours is"
the last touch of heaven left in my empty world!  I could contain
"myself no longer, and my tears flowed fast.  I covered my eyes"
"with the end of my   sari  , which I pressed to my face with"
"both my hands, and sobbed and sobbed.  And every time that I felt"
on my feet his tender touch trying to comfort me my tears broke
out afresh.

"After a little, when I had recovered myself and taken my hands"
"from my face, I saw Sandip back at the table, gathering up the"
"sovereigns in his handkerchief, as if nothing had happened."
"Amulya rose to his seat, from his place near my feet, his wet"
eyes shining.


Sandip coolly looked up at my face as he remarked:  It is six
thousand. 

" What do we want with so much, Sandip Babu?   cried Amulya."
 Three thousand five hundred is all we need for our work. 

" Our wants are not for this one place only,  Sandip replied.   We"
shall want all we can get. 

" That may be,  said Amulya.   But in future I undertake to get"
"you all you want.  Out of this, Sandip Babu, please return the"
extra two thousand five hundred to the Maharani. 

Sandip glanced enquiringly at me.

" No, no,  I exclaimed.   I shall never touch that money again."
Do with it as you will. 

" Can man ever give as woman can?   said Sandip, looking towards"
Amulya.

 They are goddesses!   agreed Amulya with enthusiasm.

" We men can at best give of our power,  continued Sandip.   But"
"women give themselves.  Out of their own life they give birth,"
out of their own life they give sustenance.  Such gifts are the
"only true gifts.   Then turning to me,  Queen!   said he,  if"
what you have given us had been only money I would not have
touched it.  But you have given that which is more to you than
life itself! 

There must be two different persons inside men.  One of these in
me can understand that Sandip is trying to delude me; the other
"is content to be deluded.  Sandip has power, but no strength of"
righteousness.  The weapon of his which rouses up life smites it
"again to death.  He has the unfailing quiver of the gods, but the"
shafts in them are of the demons.

Sandip s handkerchief was not large enough to hold all the coins.
" Queen,  he asked,  can you give me another?   When I gave him"
"mine, he reverently touched his forehead with it, and then"
suddenly kneeling on the floor he made me an obeisance.
" Goddess!   he said,  it was to offer my reverence that I had"
"approached you, but you repulsed me, and rolled me in the dust."
"Be it so, I accept your repulse as your boon to me, I raise it to"
my head in salutation!   with which he pointed to the place where
he had been hurt.

Had I then misunderstood him?  Could it be that his outstretched
"hands had really been directed towards my feet?  Yet, surely,"
"even Amulya had seen the passion that flamed out of his eyes, his"
face.  But Sandip is such an adept in setting music to his chant
of praise that I cannot argue; I lose my power of seeing truth;
"my sight is clouded over like an opium-eater s eyes.  And so,"
"after all, he gave me back twice as much in return for the blow I"
had dealt him--the wound on his head ended by making me bleed at
heart.  When I had received Sandip s obeisance my theft seemed to
"gain a dignity, and the gold glittering on the table to smile"
"away all fear of disgrace, all stings of conscience."

"Like me Amulya also was won back.  His devotion to Sandip, which"
"had suffered a momentary check, blazed up anew.  The flower-vase"
of his mind filled once more with offerings for the worship of
Sandip and me.  His simple faith shone out of his eyes with the
pure light of the morning star at dawn.

After I had offered worship and received worship my sin became
radiant.  And as Amulya looked on my face he raised his folded
hands in salutation and cried   Bande Mataram  !  I cannot
expect to have this adoration surrounding me for ever; and yet
this has come to be the only means of keeping alive my self-
respect.

I can no longer enter my bedroom.  The bedstead seems to thrust
"out a forbidding hand, the iron safe frowns at me.  I want to get"
away from this continual insult to myself which is rankling
within me.  I want to keep running to Sandip to hear him sing my
praises.  There is just this one little altar of worship which
"has kept its head above the all-pervading depths of my dishonour,"
and so I want to cleave to it night and day; for on whichever
"side I step away from it, there is only emptiness."

"Praise, praise, I want unceasing praise.  I cannot live if my"
"wine-cup be left empty for a single moment.  So, as the very"
"price of my life, I want Sandip of all the world, today."

XVII



When my husband nowadays comes in for his meals I feel I cannot
sit before him; and yet it is such a shame not to be near him
that I feel I cannot do that either.  So I seat myself where we
cannot look at each other s face.  That was how I was sitting the
other day when the Bara Rani came and joined us.

" It is all very well for you, brother,  said she,  to laugh away"
these threatening letters.  But they do frighten me so.  Have you
sent off that money you gave me to the Calcutta bank? 

" No, I have not yet had the time to get it away,  my husband"
replied.

" You are so careless, brother dear, you had better look out... "

 But it is in the iron safe right inside the inner dressing-
"room,  said my husband with a reassuring smile."

 What if they get in there?  You can never tell! 

" If they go so far, they might as well carry you off too! "

" Don t you fear, no one will come for poor me.  The real"
"attraction is in your room!  But joking apart, don t run the risk"
of keeping money in the room like that. 

 They will be taking along the Government revenue to Calcutta in
a few days now; I will send this money to the bank under the same
escort. 

" Very well.  But see you don t forget all about it, you are so"
absent-minded. 

" Even if that money gets lost, while in my room, the loss cannot"
"be yours, Sister Rani. "

" Now, now, brother, you will make me very angry if you talk in"
that way.  Was I making any difference between yours and mine?
"What if your money is lost, does not that hurt me?  If Providence"
"has thought fit to take away my all, it has not left me"
insensible to the value of the most devoted brother known since
the days of Lakshman.   [25]

" Well, Junior Rani, are you turned into a wooden doll?  You have"
"not spoken a word yet.  Do you know, brother, our Junior Rani"
thinks I try to flatter you.  If things came to that pass I
"should not hesitate to do so, but I know my dear old brother does"
not need it! 

"Thus the Senior Rani chattered on, not forgetting now and then to"
draw her brother s attention to this or that special delicacy
amongst the dishes that were being served.  My head was all the
time in a whirl.  The crisis was fast coming.  Something must be
done about replacing that money.  And as I kept asking myself
"what could be done, and how it was to be done, the unceasing"
patter of my sister-in-law s words seemed more and more
intolerable.

"What made it all the worse was, that nothing could escape my"
sister-in-law s keen eyes.  Every now and then she was casting
side glances towards me.  What she could read in my face I do not
"know, but to me it seemed that everything was written there only"
too plainly.

"Then I did an infinitely rash thing.  Affecting an easy, amused"
"laugh I said:  All the Senior Rani s suspicions, I see, are"
reserved for me--her fears of thieves and robbers are only a
feint. 

"The Senior Rani smiled mischievously.   You are right, sister"
mine.  A woman s theft is the most fatal of all thefts.  But how
"can you elude my watchfulness?  Am I a man, that you should"
hoodwink me? 

" If you fear me so,  I retorted,  let me keep in your hands all I"
"have, as security.  If I cause you loss, you can then repay"
yourself. 

" Just listen to her, our simple little Junior Rani!   she laughed"
"back, turning to my husband.   Does she not know that there are"
"losses which no security can make good, either in this world or"
in the next? 

My husband did not join in our exchange of words.  When he had
"finished, he went off to the outer apartments, for nowadays he"
does not take his mid-day rest in our room.

All my more valuable jewels were in deposit in the treasury in
charge of the cashier.  Still what I kept with me must have been
worth thirty or forty thousand.  I took my jewel-box to the Bara
"Rani s room and opened it out before her, saying:  I leave these"
"with you, sister.  They will keep you quite safe from all worry. "

The Bara Rani made a gesture of mock despair.   You positively
"astound me, Chota Rani!   she said.   Do you really suppose I"
spend sleepless nights for fear of being robbed by you? 

 What harm if you did have a wholesome fear of me?  Does anybody
know anybody else in this world? 

" You want to teach me a lesson by trusting me?  No, no!  I am"
"bothered enough to know what to do with my own jewels, without"
"keeping watch over yours.  Take them away, there s a dear, so"
many prying servants are about. 

I went straight from my sister-in-law s room to the sitting-room
"outside, and sent for Amulya.  With him Sandip came along too.  I"
"was in a great hurry, and said to Sandip:  If you don t mind, I"
want to have a word or two with Amulya.  Would you... 

Sandip smiled a wry smile.   So Amulya and I are separate in your
"eyes?  If you have set about to wean him from me, I must confess"
I have no power to retain him. 

"I made no reply, but stood waiting."

" Be it so,  Sandip went on.   Finish your special talk with"
Amulya.  But then you must give me a special talk all to myself
"too, or it will mean a defeat for me.  I can stand everything,"
but not defeat.  My share must always be the lion s share.  This
has been my constant quarrel with Providence.  I will defeat the
"Dispenser of my fate, but not take defeat at his hands.   With a"
"crushing look at Amulya, Sandip walked out of the room."

" Amulya, my own little brother, you must do one thing for me,  I"
said.

" I will stake my life for whatever duty you may lay on me,"
sister. 

I brought out my jewel-box from the folds of my shawl and placed
"it before him.   Sell or pawn these,  I said,  and get me six"
thousand rupees as fast as ever you can. 

" No, no, Sister Rani,  said Amulya, touched to the quick.   Let"
these jewels be.  I will get you six thousand all the same. 

" Oh, don t be silly,  I said impatiently.   There is no time for"
any nonsense.  Take this box.  Get away to Calcutta by the night
train.  And bring me the money by the day after tomorrow
positively. 

"Amulya took a diamond necklace out of the box, held it up to the"
light and put it back gloomily.

" I know,  I told him,  that you will never get the proper price"
"for these diamonds, so I am giving you jewels worth about thirty"
"thousand.  I don t care if they all go, but I must have that six"
thousand without fail. 

" Do you know, Sister Rani,  said Amulya,  I have had a quarrel"
with Sandip Babu over that six thousand rupees he took from you?
I cannot tell you how ashamed I felt.  But Sandip Babu would have
it that we must give up even our shame for the country.  That may
be so.  But this is somehow different.  I do not fear to die for
"the country, to kill for the country--that much   Shakti   has"
been given me.  But I cannot forget the shame of having taken
money from you.  There Sandip Babu is ahead of me.  He has no
regrets or compunctions.  He says we must get rid of the idea
that the money belongs to the one in whose box it happens to be--
"if we cannot, where is the magic of   Bande Mataram  ? "

Amulya gathered enthusiasm as he talked on.  He always warms up
"when he has me for a listener.   The Gita tells us,  he"
"continued,  that no one can kill the soul.  Killing is a mere"
word.  So also is the taking away of money.  Whose is the money?
No one has created it.  No one can take it away with him when he
"departs this life, for it is no part of his soul.  Today it is"
"mine, tomorrow my son s, the next day his creditor s.  Since, in"
"fact, money belongs to no one, why should any blame attach to our"
"patriots if, instead of leaving it for some worthless son, they"
take it for their own use? 

"When I hear Sandip s words uttered by this boy, I tremble all"
over.  Let those who are snake-charmers play with snakes; if harm
"comes to them, they are prepared for it.  But these boys are so"
"innocent, all the world is ready with its blessing to protect"
"them.  They play with a snake not knowing its nature, and when we"
"see them smilingly, trustfully, putting their hands within reach"
"of its fangs, then we understand how terribly dangerous the snake"
"is.  Sandip is right when he suspects that though I, for myself,"
"may be ready to die at his hands, this boy I shall wean from him"
and save.

 So the money is wanted for the use of your patriots?   I
questioned with a smile.

 Of course it is!   said Amulya proudly.   Are they not our
"kings?  Poverty takes away from their regal power.  Do you know,"
we always insist on Sandip Babu travelling First Class?  He never
"shirks kingly honours--he accepts them not for himself, but for"
the glory of us all.  The greatest weapon of those who rule the
"world, Sandip Babu has told us, is the hypnotism of their"
display.  To take the vow of poverty would be for them not merely
a penance--it would mean suicide. 

At this point Sandip noiselessly entered the room.  I threw my
shawl over the jewel-case with a rapid movement.

 The special-talk business not yet over?   he asked with a sneer
in his tone.

" Yes, we ve quite finished,  said Amulya apologetically.   It was"
nothing much. 

" No, Amulya,  I said,  we have not quite finished. "

" So exit Sandip for the second time, I suppose?   said Sandip."

 If you please. 

 And as to Sandip s re-entry. 

 Not today.  I have no time. 

" I see!   said Sandip as his eyes flashed.   No time to waste,"
only for special talks! 

"Jealousy!  Where the strong man shows weakness, there the weaker"
sex cannot help beating her drums of victory.  So I repeated
firmly:  I really have no time. 

Sandip went away looking black.  Amulya was greatly perturbed.
" Sister Rani,  he pleaded,  Sandip Babu is annoyed. "

" He has neither cause nor right to be annoyed,  I said with some"
"vehemence.   Let me caution you about one thing, Amulya.  Say"
nothing to Sandip Babu about the sale of my jewels--on your
life. 

" No, I will not. "

 Then you had better not delay any more.  You must get away by
tonight s train. 

Amulya and I left the room together.  As we came out on the
verandah Sandip was standing there.  I could see he was waiting
to waylay Amulya.  To prevent that I had to engage him.   What is
"it you wanted to tell me, Sandip Babu?   I asked."

 I have nothing special to say--mere small talk.  And since you
have not the time .  .   

 I can give you just a little. 

By this time Amulya had left.  As we entered the room Sandip
asked:  What was that box Amulya carried away? 

The box had not escaped his eyes.  I remained firm.   If I could
"have told you, it would have been made over to him in your"
presence! 

 So you think Amulya will not tell me? 

" No, he will not. "

Sandip could not conceal his anger any longer.   You think you
will gain the mastery over me?   he blazed out.   That shall
"never be.  Amulya, there, would die a happy death if I deigned to"
"trample him under foot.  I will never, so long as I live, allow"
you to bring him to your feet! 

"Oh, the weak!  the weak!  At last Sandip has realized that he is"
weak before me!  That is why there is this sudden outburst of
anger.  He has understood that he cannot meet the power that I
"wield, with mere strength.  With a glance I can crumble his"
strongest fortifications.  So he must needs resort to bluster.  I
simply smiled in contemptuous silence.  At last have I come to a
level above him.  I must never lose this vantage ground; never
descend lower again.  Amidst all my degradation this bit of
dignity must remain to me!

" I know,  said Sandip, after a pause,  it was your jewel-case. "

" You may guess as you please,  said I,  but you will get nothing"
out of me.

 So you trust Amulya more than you trust me?  Do you know that
"the boy is the shadow of my shadow, the echo of my echo--that he"
is nothing if I am not at his side? 

" Where he is not your echo, he is himself, Amulya.  And that is"
where I trust him more than I can trust your echo! 

 You must not forget that you are under a promise to render up
all your ornaments to me for the worship of the Divine Mother.
In fact your offering has already been made. 

 Whatever ornaments the gods leave to me will be offered up to
the gods.  But how can I offer those which have been stolen away
from me? 

" Look here, it is no use your trying to give me the slip in that"
fashion.  Now is the time for grim work.  Let that work be
"finished, then you can make a display of your woman s wiles to"
your heart s content--and I will help you in your game. 

"The moment I had stolen my husband s money and paid it to Sandip,"
the music that was in our relations stopped.  Not only did I
"destroy all my own value by making myself cheap, but Sandip s"
"powers, too, lost scope for their full play.  You cannot employ"
your marksmanship against a thing which is right in your grasp.
So Sandip has lost his aspect of the hero; a tone of low
quarrelsomeness has come into his words.

Sandip kept his brilliant eyes fixed full on my face till they
seemed to blaze with all the thirst of the mid-day sky.  Once or
"twice he fidgeted with his feet, as though to leave his seat, as"
"if to spring right on me.  My whole body seemed to swim, my veins"
"throbbed, the hot blood surged up to my ears; I felt that if I"
"remained there, I should never get up at all.  With a supreme"
"effort I tore myself off the chair, and hastened towards the"
door.

From Sandip s dry throat there came a muffled cry:  Whither would
"you flee, Queen?   The next moment he left his seat with a bound"
"to seize hold of me.  At the sound of footsteps outside the door,"
"however, he rapidly retreated and fell back into his chair.  I"
"checked my steps near the bookshelf, where I stood staring at the"
names of the books.

"As my husband entered the room, Sandip exclaimed:  I say, Nikhil,"
don t you keep Browning among your books here?  I was just
telling Queen Bee of our college club.  Do you remember that
contest of ours over the translation of those lines from
Browning?  You don t?

/*
"   She should never have looked at me,"
"  If she meant I should not love her,"
"  There are plenty ...  men you call such,"
  I suppose ...  she may discover

  And yet leave much as she found them:
"  But I m not so, and she knew it"
"  When she fixed me, glancing round them."
*/

" I managed to get together the words to render it into Bengali,"
"somehow, but the result was hardly likely to be a  joy forever "
to the people of Bengal.  I really did think at one time that I
"was on the verge of becoming a poet, but Providence was kind"
enough to save me from that disaster.  Do you remember old
"Dakshina?  If he had not become a Salt Inspector, he would have"
been a poet.  I remember his rendering to this day ...

" No, Queen Bee, it is no use rummaging those bookshelves.  Nikhil"
has ceased to read poetry since his marriage--perhaps he has no
"further need for it.  But I suppose  the fever fit of poesy , as"
"the Sanskrit has it, is about to attack me again. "

" I have come to give you a warning, Sandip,  said my husband."

 About the fever fit of poesy? 

My husband took no notice of this attempt at humour.   For some
"time,  he continued,  Mahomedan preachers have been about"
"stirring up the local Mussulmans.  They are all wild with you,"
and may attack you any moment. 

 Are you come to advise flight? 

" I have come to give you information, not to offer advice. "

" Had these estates been mine, such a warning would have been"
"necessary for the preachers, not for me.  If, instead of trying"
"to frighten me, you give them a taste of your intimidation, that"
would be worthier both of you and me.  Do you know that your
weakness is weakening your neighbouring   zamindars   also? 

" I did not offer you my advice, Sandip.  I wish you, too, would"
"refrain from giving me yours.  Besides, it is useless.  And there"
is another thing I want to tell you.  You and your followers have
been secretly worrying and oppressing my tenantry.  I cannot
allow that any longer.  So I must ask you to leave my territory. 

" For fear of the Mussulmans, or is there any other fear you have"
to threaten me with? 

 There are fears the want of which is cowardice.  In the name of
"those fears, I tell you, Sandip, you must go.  In five days I"
shall be starting for Calcutta.  I want you to accompany me.  You
may of course stay in my house there--to that there is no
objection. 

" All right, I have still five day s time then.  Meanwhile, Queen"
"Bee, let me hum to you my song of parting from your honey-hive."
Ah!  you poet of modern Bengal!  Throw open your doors and let me
"plunder your words.  The theft is really yours, for it is my song"
"which you have made your own--let the name be yours by all means,"
"but the song is mine.   With this Sandip struck up in a deep,"
"husky voice, which threatened to be out of tune, a song in the"
Bhairavi mode:

/*
"   In the springtime of your kingdom, my Queen,"
  Meetings and partings chase each other in their endless hide
"    and seek,"
  And flowers blossom in the wake of those that droop and die in
    the shade.
"  In the springtime of your kingdom, my Queen,"
"  My meeting with you had its own songs,"
  But has not also my leave-taking any gift to offer you?
"  That gift is my secret hope, which I keep hidden in the shadows"
"    of your flower garden,"
  That the rains of July may sweetly temper your fiery June. 
*/

"His boldness was immense--boldness which had no veil, but was naked"
as fire.  One finds no time to stop it: it is like trying
to resist a thunderbolt: the lightning flashes: it laughs at all
resistance.

I left the room.  As I was passing along the verandah towards the
"inner apartments, Amulya suddenly made his appearance and came"
and stood before me.

" Fear nothing, Sister Rani,  he said.   I am off tonight and"
shall not return unsuccessful. 

" Amulya,  said I, looking straight into his earnest, youthful"
"face,  I fear nothing for myself, but may I never cease to fear"
for you. 

"Amulya turned to go, but before he was out of sight I called him"
"back and asked:  Have you a mother, Amulya? "

 I have. 

 A sister? 

" No, I am the only child of my mother.  My father died when I was"
quite little. 

" Then go back to your mother, Amulya. "

" But, Sister Rani, I have now both mother and sister. "

" Then, Amulya, before you leave tonight, come and have your"
dinner here. 

 There won t be time for that.  Let me take some food for the
"journey, consecrated with your touch. "

" What do you specially like, Amulya? "
 If I had been with my mother I should have had lots of Poush
"cakes.  Make some for me with your own hands, Sister Rani! "

25. Of the   Ramayana  .  The story of his devotion to his
"elder brother Rama and his brother s wife Sita, has become a"
byword.



Chapter Ten

Nikhil s Story

XII



I LEARNT from my master that Sandip had joined forces with Harish
"Kundu, and there was to be a grand celebration of the worship of"
the demon-destroying Goddess.  Harish Kundu was extorting the
expenses from his tenantry.  Pandits Kaviratna and Vidyavagish
had been commissioned to compose a hymn with a double meaning.

My master has just had a passage at arms with Sandip over this.
" Evolution is at work amongst the gods as well,  says Sandip."
 The grandson has to remodel the gods created by the grandfather
"to suit his own taste, or else he is left an atheist.  It is my"
mission to modernize the ancient deities.  I am born the saviour
"of the gods, to emancipate them from the thraldom of the past. "

I have seen from our boyhood what a juggler with ideas is Sandip.
"He has no interest in discovering truth, but to make a quizzical"
display of it rejoices his heart.  Had he been born in the wilds
of Africa he would have spent a glorious time inventing argument
after argument to prove that cannibalism is the best means of
promoting true communion between man and man.  But those who deal
"in delusion end by deluding themselves, and I fully believe that,"
"each time Sandip creates a new fallacy, he persuades himself that"
"he has found the truth, however contradictory his creations may"
be to one another.

"However, I shall not give a helping hand to establish a liquor"
"distillery in my country.  The young men, who are ready to offer"
"their services for their country s cause, must not fall into this"
habit of getting intoxicated.  The people who want to exact work
by drugging methods set more value on the excitement than on the
minds they intoxicate.

"I had to tell Sandip, in Bimala s presence, that he must go."
Perhaps both will impute to me the wrong motive.  But I must free
myself also from all fear of being misunderstood.  Let even
Bimala misunderstand me ...

A number of Mahomedan preachers are being sent over from Dacca.
The Mussulmans in my territory had come to have almost as much of
an aversion to the killing of cows as the Hindus.  But now cases
of cow-killing are cropping up here and there.  I had the news
first from some of my Mussulman tenants with expressions of their
disapproval.  Here was a situation which I could see would be
"difficult to meet.  At the bottom was a pretence of fanaticism,"
which would cease to be a pretence if obstructed.  That is just
where the ingenuity of the move came in!

I sent for some of my principal Hindu tenants and tried to get
them to see the matter in its proper light.   We can be staunch
"in our own convictions,  I said,  but we have no control over"
"those of others.  For all that many of us are Vaishnavas, those"
of us who are Shaktas go on with their animal sacrifices just the
"same.  That cannot be helped.  We must, in the same way, let the"
Mussulmans do as they think best.  So please refrain from all
disturbance. 

" Maharaja,  they replied,  these outrages have been unknown for"
so long. 

" That was so,  I said,  because such was their spontaneous"
desire.  Let us behave in such a way that the same may become
"true, over again.  But a breach of the peace is not the way to"
bring this about. 

" No, Maharaja,  they insisted,  those good old days are gone."
This will never stop unless you put it down with a strong hand. 

" Oppression,  I replied,  will not only not prevent cow-killing,"
it may lead to the killing of men as well. 

One of them had had an English education.  He had learnt to
repeat the phrases of the day.   It is not only a question of
"orthodoxy,  he argued.   Our country is mainly agricultural, and"
cows are ... 

" Buffaloes in this country,  I interrupted,  likewise give milk"
"and are used for ploughing.  And therefore, so long as we dance"
"frantic dances on our temple pavements, smeared with their blood,"
"their severed heads carried on our shoulders, religion will only"
"laugh at us if we quarrel with Mussulmans in her name, and"
nothing but the quarrel itself will remain true.  If the cow
"alone is to be held sacred from slaughter, and not the buffalo,"
"then that is bigotry, not religion. "

" But are you not aware, sir, of what is behind all this? "
pursued the English-knowing tenant.   This has only become
"possible because the Mussulman is assured of safety, even if he"
breaks the law.  Have you not heard of the Pachur case? 

" Why is it possible,  I asked,  to use the Mussulmans thus, as"
tools against us?  Is it not because we have fashioned them into
such with our own intolerance?  That is how Providence punishes
us.  Our accumulated sins are being visited on our own heads. 

" Oh, well, if that be so, let them be visited on us.  But we"
shall have our revenge.  We have undermined what was the greatest
"strength of the authorities, their devotion to their own laws."
"Once they were truly kings, dispensing justice; now they"
"themselves will become law-breakers, and so no better than"
"robbers.  This may not go down to history, but we shall carry it"
in our hearts for all time ... 

The evil reports about me which are spreading from paper to paper
are making me notorious.  News comes that my effigy has been
"burnt at the river-side burning-ground of the Chakravartis, with"
due ceremony and enthusiasm; and other insults are in
contemplation.  The trouble was that they had come to ask me to
take shares in a Cotton Mill they wanted to start.  I had to tell
"them that I did not so much mind the loss of my own money, but I"
would not be a party to causing a loss to so many poor
shareholders.

" Are we to understand, Maharaja,  said my visitors,  that the"
prosperity of the country does not interest you? 

" Industry may lead to the country s prosperity,  I explained,"
 but a mere desire for its prosperity will not make for success
"in industry.  Even when our heads were cool, our industries did"
not flourish.  Why should we suppose that they will do so just
because we have become frantic? 

 Why not say plainly that you will not risk your money? 

 I will put in my money when I see that it is industry which
"prompts you.  But, because you have lighted a fire, it does not"
follow that you have the food to cook over it.

What is this?  Our Chakua sub-treasury looted!  A remittance of
seven thousand five hundred rupees was due from there to
headquarters.  The local cashier had changed the cash at the
Government Treasury into small currency notes for convenience in
"carrying, and had kept them ready in bundles.  In the middle of"
"the night an armed band had raided the room, and wounded Kasim,"
the man on guard.  The curious part of it was that they had taken
only six thousand rupees and left the rest scattered on the
"floor, though it would have been as easy to carry that away also."
"Anyhow, the raid of the dacoits was over; now the police raid"
would begin.  Peace was out of the question.

"When I went inside, I found the news had travelled before me."
" What a terrible thing, brother,  exclaimed the Bara Rani."
 Whatever shall we do? 

I made light of the matter to reassure her.   We still have
"something left,  I said with a smile.   We shall manage to get"
along somehow. 

" Don t joke about it, brother dear.  Why are they all so angry"
with you?  Can t you humour them?  Why put everybody out? 

" I cannot let the country go to rack and ruin, even if that would"
please everybody. 

 That was a shocking thing they did at the burning-grounds.  It s
a horrid shame to treat you so.  The Chota Rani has got rid of
"all her fears by dint of the Englishwoman s teaching, but as for"
"me, I had to send for the priest to avert the omen before I could"
"get any peace of mind.  For my sake, dear, do get away to"
"Calcutta.  I tremble to think what they may do, if you stay on"
here. 

My sister-in-law s genuine anxiety touched me deeply.

" And, brother,  she went on,  did I not warn you, it was not well"
to keep so much money in your room?  They might get wind of it
any day.  It is not the money--but who knows... 

To calm her I promised to remove the money to the treasury at
"once, and then get it away to Calcutta with the first escort"
going.  We went together to my bedroom.  The dressing-room door
"was shut.  When I knocked, Bimala called out:  I am dressing. "

" I wonder at the Chota Rani,  exclaimed my sister-in-law,"
 dressing so early in the day!  One of their   Bande Mataram  
"meetings, I suppose.  Robber Queen!   she called out in jest to"
Bimala.   Are you counting your spoils inside? 

" I will attend to the money a little later,  I said, as I came"
away to my office room outside.

I found the Police Inspector waiting for me.   Any trace of the
dacoits?   I asked.

 I have my suspicions. 

 On whom? 

" Kasim, the guard. "

 Kasim?  But was he not wounded? 

 A mere nothing.  A flesh wound on the leg.  Probably self-
inflicted. 

 But I cannot bring myself to believe it.  He is such a trusted
servant. 

" You may have trusted him, but that does not prevent his being a"
"thief.  Have I not seen men trusted for twenty years together,"
suddenly developing... 

" Even if it were so, I could not send him to gaol.  But why"
should he have left the rest of the money lying about? 

" To put us off the scent.  Whatever you may say, Maharaja, he"
must be an old hand at the game.  He mounts guard during his
"watch, right enough, but I feel sure he has a finger in all the"
dacoities going on in the neighbourhood. 

With this the Inspector proceeded to recount the various methods
by which it was possible to be concerned in a dacoity twenty or
"thirty miles away, and yet be back in time for duty."

 Have you brought Kasim here?   I asked.

" No,  was the reply,  he is in the lock-up.  The Magistrate is"
due for the investigation. 

" I want to see him,  I said."

"When I went to his cell he fell at my feet, weeping.   In God s"
"name,  he said,  I swear I did not do this thing. "

" I do not doubt you, Kasim,  I assured him.   Fear nothing.  They"
"can do nothing to you, if you are innocent. "

"Kasim, however, was unable to give a coherent account of the"
incident.  He was obviously exaggerating.  Four or five hundred
"men, big guns, numberless swords, figured in his narrative.  It"
must have been either his disturbed state of mind or a desire to
account for his easy defeat.  He would have it that this was
Harish Kundu s doing; he was even sure he had heard the voice of
"Ekram, the head retainer of the Kundus."

" Look here, Kasim,  I had to warn him,  don t you be dragging"
other people in with your stories.  You are not called upon to
"make out a case against Harish Kundu, or anybody else. "

XIV



On returning home I asked my master to come over.  He shook his
"head gravely.   I see no good in this,  said he-- this setting"
aside of conscience and putting the country in its place.  All
"the sins of the country will now break out, hideous and"
unashamed. 

 Who do you think could have ... 

" Don t ask me.  But sin is rampant.  Send them all away, right"
away from here. 

 I have given them one more day.  They will be leaving the day
after tomorrow. 

 And another thing.  Take Bimala away to Calcutta.  She is
"getting too narrow a view of the outside world from here, she"
cannot see men and things in their true proportions.  Let her see
the world--men and their work--give her abroad vision. 

 That is exactly what I was thinking. 

" Well, don t make any delay about it.  I tell you, Nikhil, man s"
history has to be built by the united effort of all the races in
"the world, and therefore this selling of conscience for political"
"reasons--this making a fetish of one s country, won t do.  I know"
"that Europe does not at heart admit this, but there she has not"
the right to pose as our teacher.  Men who die for the truth
"become immortal: and, if a whole people can die for the truth, it"
"will also achieve immortality in the history of humanity.  Here,"
"in this land of India, amid the mocking laughter of Satan"
"piercing the sky, may the feeling for this truth become real!"
What a terrible epidemic of sin has been brought into our country
from foreign lands... 

The whole day passed in the turmoil of investigation.  I was
tired out when I retired for the night.  I left over sending my
sister-in-law s money to the treasury till next morning.

I woke up from my sleep at dead of night.  The room was dark.  I
thought I heard a moaning somewhere.  Somebody must have been
crying.  Sounds of sobbing came heavy with tears like fitful
gusts of wind in the rainy night.  It seemed to me that the cry
rose from the heart of my room itself.  I was alone.  For some
days Bimala had her bed in another room adjoining mine.  I rose
up and when I went out I found her in the balcony lying prone
upon her face on the bare floor.

This is something that cannot be written in words.  He only knows
it who sits in the bosom of the world and receives all its pangs
"in His own heart.  The sky is dumb, the stars are mute, the night"
"is still, and in the midst of it all that one sleepless cry!"

"We give these sufferings names, bad or good, according to the"
"classifications of the books, but this agony which is welling up"
"from a torn heart, pouring into the fathomless dark, has it any"
"name?  When in that midnight, standing under the silent stars, I"
"looked upon that figure, my mind was struck with awe, and I said"
"to myself:  Who am Ito judge her?   O life, O death, O God of the"
"infinite existence, I bow my head in silence to the mystery which"
is in you.

Once I thought I should turn back.  But I could not.  I sat down
on the ground near Bimala and placed my hand on her head.  At the
"first touch her whole body seemed to stiffen, but the next moment"
"the hardness gave way, and the tears burst out.  I gently passed"
my fingers over her forehead.  Suddenly her hands groping for my
"feet grasped them and drew them to herself, pressing them against"
her breast with such force that I thought her heart would break.



Bimala s Story

XVIII



Amulya is due to return from Calcutta this morning.  I told the
"servants to let me know as soon as he arrived, but could not keep"
still.  At last I went outside to await him in the sitting-room.

When I sent him off to sell the jewels I must have been thinking
only of myself.  It never even crossed my mind that so young a
"boy, trying to sell such valuable jewellery, would at once be"
"suspected.  So helpless are we women, we needs must place on"
others the burden of our danger.  When we go to our death we drag
down those who are about us.

I had said with pride that I would save Amulya--as if she who was
"drowning could save others.  But instead of saving him, I have"
"sent him to his doom.  My little brother, such a sister have I"
been to you that Death must have smiled on that Brothers  Day
"when I gave you my blessing--I, who wander distracted with the"
burden of my own evil-doing.

I feel today that man is at times attacked with evil as with the
"plague.  Some germ finds its way in from somewhere, and then in"
the space of one night Death stalks in.  Why cannot the stricken
"one be kept far away from the rest of the world?  I, at least,"
have realized how terrible is the contagion--like a fiery torch
which burns that it may set the world on fire.

It struck nine.  I could not get rid of the idea that Amulya was
"in trouble, that he had fallen into the clutches of the police."
There must be great excitement in the Police Office--whose are
the jewels?--where did he get them?  And in the end I shall have
"to furnish the answer, in public, before all the world."

"What is that answer to be?  Your day has come at last, Bara Rani,"
"you whom I have so long despised.  You, in the shape of the"
"public, the world, will have your revenge.  O God, save me this"
"time, and I will cast all my pride at my sister-in-law s feet."

I could bear it no longer.  I went straight to the Bara Rani.
"She was in the verandah, spicing her betel leaves, Thako at her"
"side.  The sight of Thako made me shrink back for a moment, but I"
"overcame all hesitation, and making a low obeisance I took the"
dust of my elder sister-in-law s feet.

" Bless my soul, Chota Rani,  she exclaimed,  what has come upon"
you?  Why this sudden reverence? 

" It is my birthday, sister,  said I.   I have caused you pain."
Give me your blessing today that I may never do so again.  My
mind is so small.   I repeated my obeisance and left her
"hurriedly, but she called me back."

" You never before told me that this was your birthday, Chotie"
darling!  Be sure to come and have lunch with me this afternoon.
You positively must. 

"O God, let it really be my birthday today.  Can I not be born"
"over again?  Cleanse me, my God, and purify me and give me one"
more trial!

I went again to the sitting-room to find Sandip there.  A feeling
"of disgust seemed to poison my very blood.  The face of his,"
"which I saw in the morning light, had nothing of the magic"
radiance of genius.

" Will you leave the room,  I blurted out."

"Sandip smiled.   Since Amulya is not here,  he remarked,  I"
should think my turn had come for a special talk. 

My fate was coming back upon me.  How was Ito take away the right
"I myself had given.   I would be alone,  I repeated."

" Queen,  he said,  the presence of another person does not"
prevent your being alone.  Do not mistake me for one of the
"crowd.  I, Sandip, am always alone, even when surrounded by"
thousands. 

 Please come some other time.  This morning I am ... 

 Waiting for Amulya? 

"I turned to leave the room for sheer vexation, when Sandip drew"
out from the folds of his cloak that jewel-casket of mine and
banged it down on the marble table.  I was thoroughly startled.
" Has not Amulya gone, then?   I exclaimed."

 Gone where? 

 To Calcutta? 

" No,  chuckled Sandip."

"Ah, then my blessing had come true, in spite of all.  He was"
"saved.  Let God s punishment fall on me, the thief, if only"
Amulya be safe.

"The change in my countenance roused Sandip s scorn.   So pleased,"
Queen!   sneered he.   Are these jewels so very precious?  How
then did you bring yourself to offer them to the Goddess?  Your
gift was actually made.  Would you now take it back? 

Pride dies hard and raises its fangs to the last.  It was clear
to me I must show Sandip I did not care a rap about these jewels.
" If they have excited your greed,  I said,  you may have them. "

" My greed today embraces the wealth of all Bengal,  replied"
Sandip.   Is there a greater force than greed?  It is the steed
"of the great ones of the earth, as is the elephant, Airauat, the"
steed of Indra.  So then these jewels are mine? 

"As Sandip took up and replaced the casket under his cloak, Amulya"
"rushed in.  There were dark rings under his eyes, his lips were"
"dry, his hair tumbled: the freshness of his youth seemed to have"
withered in a single day.  Pangs gripped my heart as I looked on
him.

" My box!   he cried, as he went straight up to Sandip without a"
glance at me.   Have you taken that jewel-box from my trunk? 

 Your jewel-box?   mocked Sandip.

 It was my trunk! 
Sandip burst out into a laugh.   Your distinctions between mine
"and yours are getting rather thin, Amulya,  he cried.   You will"
"die a religious preacher yet, I see. "

Amulya sank on a chair with his face in his hands.  I went up to
him and placing my hand on his head asked him:  What is your
"trouble, Amulya? "

"He stood straight up as he replied:  I had set my heart, Sister"
"Rani, on returning your jewels to you with my own hand.  Sandip"
"Babu knew this, but he forestalled me. "

 What do I care for my jewels?   I said.   Let them go.  No harm
is done.

 Go?  Where?   asked the mystified boy.

" The jewels are mine,  said Sandip.   Insignia bestowed on me by"
my Queen! 

" No, no, no,  broke out Amulya wildly.   Never, Sister Rani!  I"
brought them back for you.  You shall not give them away to
anybody else. 

" I accept your gift, my little brother,  said I.   But let him,"
"who hankers after them, satisfy his greed. "

"Amulya glared at Sandip like a beast of prey, as he growled:"
" Look here, Sandip Babu, you know that even hanging has no"
terrors for me.  If you dare take away that box of jewels ... 

With an attempt at a sarcastic laugh Sandip said:  You also ought
"to know by this time, Amulya, that I am not the man to be afraid"
of you. 

" Queen Bee,  he went on, turning to me,  I did not come here"
"today to take these jewels, I came to give them to you.  You"
would have done wrong to take my gift at Amulya s hands.  In
"order to prevent it, I had first to make them clearly mine.  Now"
these my jewels are my gift to you.  Here they are!  Patch up any
understanding with this boy you like.  I must go.  You have been
"at your special talks all these days together, leaving me out of"
"them.  If special happenings now come to pass, don t blame me."

" Amulya,  he continued,  I have sent on your trunks and things to"
your lodgings.  Don t you be keeping any belongings of yours in
"my room any longer.   With this parting shot, Sandip flung out of"
the room.

XIX



" I have had no peace of mind, Amulya,  I said to him,  ever since"
I sent you off to sell my jewels. 

" Why, Sister Rani? "

" I was afraid lest you should get into trouble with them, lest"
they should suspect you for a thief.  I would rather go without
that six thousand.  You must now do another thing for me--go home
"at once, home to your mother. "

"Amulya produced a small bundle and said:  But, sister, I have got"
the six thousand. 

 Where from? 

" I tried hard to get gold,  he went on, without replying to my"
"question,  but could not.  So I had to bring it in notes. "

" Tell me truly, Amulya, swear by me, where did you get this"
money? 

 That I will not tell you. 

Everything seemed to grow dark before my eyes.   What terrible
"thing have you done, Amulya?   I cried.   Is it then ... "

" I know you will say I got this money wrongly.  Very well, I"
admit it.  But I have paid the full price for my wrong-doing.  So
now the money is mine. 

I no longer had any desire to learn more about it.  My very
"blood-vessels contracted, making my whole body shrink within"
itself.

" Take it away, Amulya,  I implored.   Put it back where you got"
it from. 

 That would be hard indeed! 

" It is not hard, brother dear.  It was an evil moment when you"
first came to me.  Even Sandip has not been able to harm you as I
have done. 

Sandip s name seemed to stab him.

 Sandip!   he cried.   It was you alone who made me come to know
"that man for what he is.  Do you know, sister, he has not spent a"
pice out of those sovereigns he took from you?  He shut himself
"into his room, after he left you, and gloated over the gold,"
"pouring it out in a heap on the floor.   This is not money,  he"
"exclaimed,  but the petals of the divine lotus of power;"
crystallized strains of music from the pipes that play in the
"paradise of wealth!  I cannot find it in my heart to change them,"
for they seem longing to fulfil their destiny of adorning the
"neck of Beauty.  Amulya, my boy, don t you look at these with"
"your fleshly eye, they are Lakshmi s smile, the gracious radiance"
"of Indra s queen.  No, no, I can t give them up to that boor of a"
"manager.  I am sure, Amulya, he was telling us lies.  The police"
haven t traced the man who sank that boat.  It s the manager who
wants to make something out of it.  We must get those letters
back from him. 

 I asked him how we were to do this; he told me to use force or
"threats.  I offered to do so if he would return the gold.  That,"
"he said, we could consider later.  I will not trouble you,"
"sister, with all I did to frighten the man into giving up those"
letters and burn them--it is a long story.  That very night I
came to Sandip and said:  We are now safe.  Let me have the
"sovereigns to return them tomorrow to my sister, the Maharani. "
"But he cried,  What infatuation is this of yours?  Your precious"
sister s skirt bids fair to hide the whole country from you.  Say
  Bande Mataram   and exorcize the evil spirit. 

" You know, Sister Rani, the power of Sandip s magic.  The gold"
remained with him.  And I spent the whole dark night on the
bathing-steps of the lake muttering   Bande Mataram  .

" Then when you gave me your jewels to sell, I went again to"
Sandip.  I could see he was angry with me.  But he tried not to
show it.   If I still have them hoarded up in any box of mine you
"may take them,  said he, as he flung me his keys.  They were"
"nowhere to be seen.   Tell me where they are,  I said.   I will"
"do so,  he replied,  when I find your infatuation has left you."
Not now. 

" When I found I could not move him, I had to employ other"
methods.  Then I tried to get the sovereigns from him in exchange
for my currency notes for six thousand rupees.   You shall have
"them,  he said, and disappeared into his bedroom, leaving me"
waiting outside.  There he broke open my trunk and came straight
to you with your casket through some other passage.  He would not
"let me bring it, and now he dares call it his gift.  How can I"
tell how much he has deprived me of?  I shall never forgive him.

" But, oh sister, his power over me has been utterly broken.  And"
it is you who have broken it! 

" Brother dear,  said I,  if that is so, then my life is"
"justified.  But more remains to be done, Amulya.  It is not"
enough that the spell has been destroyed.  Its stains must be
"washed away.  Don t delay any longer, go at once and put back the"
"money where you took it from.  Can you not do it, dear? "

" With your blessing everything is possible, Sister Rani. "

" Remember, it will not be your expiation alone, but mine also.  I"
"am a woman; the outside world is closed to me, else I would have"
gone myself.  My hardest punishment is that I must put on you the
burden of my sin. 

" Don t say that, sister.  The path I was treading was not your"
path.  It attracted me because of its dangers and difficulties.
"Now that your path calls me, let it be a thousand times more"
"difficult and dangerous, the dust of your feet will help me to"
win through.  Is it then your command that this money be
replaced? 

" Not my command, brother mine, but a command from above. "

 Of that I know nothing.  It is enough for me that this command
"from above comes from your lips.  And, sister, I thought I had an"
invitation here.  I must not lose that.  You must give me your
"  prasad   [26] before I go.  Then, if I can possibly manage"
"it, I will finish my duty in the evening. "

Tears came to my eyes when I tried to smile as I said:  So be
it.

Chapter Eleven

Bimala s Story

XX



WITH Amulya s departure my heart sank within me.  On what
perilous adventure had I sent this only son of his mother?  O
"God, why need my expiation have such pomp and circumstance?"
Could I not be allowed to suffer alone without inviting all this
"multitude to share my punishment?  Oh, let not this innocent"
child fall victim to Your wrath.

I called him back-- Amulya! 

"My voice sounded so feebly, it failed to reach him."

I went up to the door and called again:  Amulya! 

He had gone.

 Who is there? 

 Rani Mother! 

 Go and tell Amulya Babu that I want him. 

"What exactly happened I could not make out--the man, perhaps, was"
not familiar with Amulya s name--but he returned almost at once
followed by Sandip.

" The very moment you sent me away,  he said as he came in,  I had"
a presentiment that you would call me back.  The attraction of
the same moon causes both ebb and flow.  I was so sure of being
"sent for, that I was actually waiting out in the passage.  As"
"soon as I caught sight of your man, coming from your room, I"
"said:  Yes, yes, I am coming, I am coming at once! --before he"
"could utter a word.  That up-country lout was surprised, I can"
"tell you!  He stared at me, open-mouthed, as if he thought I knew"
magic.

" All the fights in the world, Queen Bee,  Sandip rambled on,  are"
really fights between hypnotic forces.  Spell cast against spell
#NAME?
"have met in you my match.  Your quiver is full, I know, you"
artful warrior Queen!  You are the only one in the world who has
"been able to turn Sandip out and call Sandip back, at your sweet"
"will.  Well, your quarry is at your feet.  What will you do with"
"him now?  Will you give him the coup de grce, or keep him in"
"your cage?  Let me warn you beforehand, Queen, you will find the"
beast as difficult to kill outright as to keep in bondage.
"Anyway, why lose time in trying your magic weapons? "

"Sandip must have felt the shadow of approaching defeat, and this"
made him try to gain time by chattering away without waiting for
a reply.  I believe he knew that I had sent the messenger for
"Amulya, whose name the man must have mentioned.  In spite of that"
he had deliberately played this trick.  He was now trying to
avoid giving me any opening to tell him that it was Amulya I
"wanted, not him.  But his stratagem was futile, for I could see"
his weakness through it.  I must not yield up a pin s point of
the ground I had gained.

" Sandip Babu,  I said,  I wonder how you can go on making these"
"endless speeches, without a stop.  Do you get them up by heart,"
beforehand? 

Sandip s face flushed instantly.

" I have heard,  I continued,  that our professional reciters keep"
"a book full of all kinds of ready-made discourses, which can be"
fitted into any subject.  Have you also a book? 

Sandip ground out his reply through his teeth.   God has given
"you women a plentiful supply of coquetry to start with, and on"
the top of that you have the milliner and the jeweller to help
you; but do not think we men are so helpless ... 

" You had better go back and look up your book, Sandip Babu.  You"
are getting your words all wrong.  That s just the trouble with
trying to repeat things by rote. 

" You!   shouted Sandip, losing all control over himself.   You to"
insult me thus!  What is there left of you that I do not know to
the very bottom?  What ...   He became speechless.

"Sandip, the wielder of magic spells, is reduced to utter"
"powerlessness, whenever his spell refuses to work.  From a king"
"he fell to the level of a boor.  Oh, the joy of witnessing his"
"weakness!  The harsher he became in his rudeness, the more did"
"this joy well up within me.  His snaky coils, with which he used"
"to snare me, are exhausted--I am free.  I am saved, saved.  Be"
"rude to me, insult me, for that shows you in your truth; but"
"spare me your songs of praise, which were false."

My husband came in at this juncture.  Sandip had not the
"elasticity to recover himself in a moment, as he used to do"
before.  My husband looked at him for a while in surprise.  Had
this happened some days ago I should have felt ashamed.  But
today I was pleased--whatever my husband might think.  I wanted
to have it out to the finish with my weakening adversary.

"Finding us both silent and constrained, my husband hesitated a"
"little, and then took a chair.   Sandip,  he said,  I have been"
"looking for you, and was told you were here. "

" I am here,  said Sandip with some emphasis.   Queen Bee sent for"
"me early this morning.  And I, the humble worker of the hive,"
left all else to attend her summons. 

 I am going to Calcutta tomorrow.  You will come with me.

" And why, pray?  Do you take me for one of your retinue? "

" Oh, very well, take it that you are going to Calcutta, and that"
I am your follower. 

 I have no business there. 

 All the more reason for going.  You have too much business
here. 

 I don t propose to stir. 

 Then I propose to shift you. 

 Forcibly? 

 Forcibly. 

" Very well, then, I will make a move.  But the world is not"
divided between Calcutta and your estates.  There are other
places on the map. 

" From the way you have been going on, one would hardly have"
thought that there was any other place in the world except my
estates. 

"Sandip stood up.   It does happen at times,  he said,  that a"
man s whole world is reduced to a single spot.  I have realized
"my universe in this sitting-room of yours, that is why I have"
been a fixture here. 

"Then he turned to me.   None but you, Queen Bee,  he said,  will"
understand my words--perhaps not even you.  I salute you.  With
worship in my heart I leave you.  My watchword has changed since
you have come across my vision.  It is no longer   Bande
"Mataram   (Hail Mother), but Hail Beloved, Hail Enchantress."
"The mother protects, the mistress leads to destruction--but sweet"
is that destruction.  You have made the anklet sounds of the
"dance of death tinkle in my heart.  You have changed for me, your"
"devotee, the picture I had of this Bengal of ours-- the soft"
breeze-cooled land of pure water and sweet fruit.  [27] You have
"no pity, my beloved.  You have come to me with your poison cup"
"and I shall drain it, either to die in agony or live triumphing"
over death.

" Yes,  he continued.   The mother s day is past.  O love, my"
"love, you have made as naught for me the truth and right and"
heaven itself.  All duties have become as shadows: all rules and
"restraints have snapped their bonds.  O love, my love, I could"
set fire to all the world outside this land on which you have set
"your dainty feet, and dance in mad revel over the ashes ..."
These are mild men.  These are good men.  They would do good to
"all--as if this all were a reality!  No, no!  There is no reality"
in the world save this one real love of mine.  I do you
reverence.  My devotion to you has made me cruel; my worship of
you has lighted the raging flame of destruction within me.  I am
"not righteous.  I have no beliefs, I only believe in her whom,"
"above all else in the world, I have been able to realize. "

"Wonderful!  It was wonderful, indeed.  Only a minute ago I had"
despised this man with all my heart.  But what I had thought to
be dead ashes now glowed with living fire.  The fire in him is
"true, that is beyond doubt.  Oh why has God made man such a mixed"
creature?  Was it only to show his supernatural sleight of hand?
"Only a few minutes ago I had thought that Sandip, whom I had once"
"taken to be a hero, was only the stage hero of melodrama.  But"
"that is not so, not so.  Even behind the trappings of the"
"theatre, a true hero may sometimes be lurking."

"There is much in Sandip that is coarse, that is sensuous, that is"
"false, much that is overlaid with layer after layer of fleshly"
covering.  Yet--yet it is best to confess that there is a great
"deal in the depths of him which we do not, cannot understand--"
much in ourselves too.  A wonderful thing is man.  What great
mysterious purpose he is working out only the Terrible One [28]
knows--meanwhile we groan under the brunt of it.  Shiva is the
Lord of Chaos.  He is all Joy.  He will destroy our bonds.

"I cannot but feel, again and again, that there are two persons in"
me.  One recoils from Sandip in his terrible aspect of Chaos--the
other feels that very vision to be sweetly alluring.  The sinking
ship drags down all who are swimming round it.  Sandip is just
such a force of destruction.  His immense attraction gets hold of
"one before fear can come to the rescue, and then, in the"
"twinkling of an eye, one is drawn away, irresistibly, from all"
"light, all good, all freedom of the sky, all air that can be"
"breathed--from lifelong accumulations, from everyday cares--right"
to the bottom of dissolution.

From some realm of calamity has Sandip come as its messenger; and
"as he stalks the land, muttering unholy incantations, to him"
"flock all the boys and youths.  The mother, seated in the lotus-"
"heart of the Country, is wailing her heart out; for they have"
"broken open her store-room, there to hold their drunken revelry."
Her vintage of the draught for the immortals they would pour out
on the dust; her time-honoured vessels they would smash to
"pieces.  True, I feel with her; but, at the same time, I cannot"
help being infected with their excitement.

Truth itself has sent us this temptation to test our trustiness
in upholding its commandments.  Intoxication masquerades in
"heavenly garb, and dances before the pilgrims saying:  Fools you"
are that pursue the fruitless path of renunciation.  Its way is
"long, its time passing slow.  So the Wielder of the Thunderbolt"
"has sent me to you.  Behold, I the beautiful, the passionate, I"
will accept you--in my embrace you shall find fulfilment. 

"After a pause Sandip addressed me again:  Goddess, the time has"
come for me to leave you.  It is well.  The work of your nearness
has been done.  By lingering longer it would only become undone
"again, little by little.  All is lost, if in our greed we try to"
cheapen that which is the greatest thing on earth.  That which is
eternal within the moment only becomes shallow if spread out in
"time.  We were about to spoil our infinite moment, when it was"
your uplifted thunderbolt which came to the rescue.  You
intervened to save the purity of your own worship--and in so
doing you also saved your worshipper.  In my leave-taking today
"your worship stands out the biggest thing.  Goddess, I, also, set"
you free today.  My earthen temple could hold you no longer--
every moment it was on the point of breaking apart.  Today I
depart to worship your larger image in a larger temple.  I can
gain you more truly only at a distance from yourself.  Here I had
"only your favour, there I shall be vouchsafed your boon. "

My jewel-casket was lying on the table.  I held it up aloft as I
said:  I charge you to convey these my jewels to the object of my
worship--to whom I have dedicated them through you. 

My husband remained silent.  Sandip left the room.

I had just sat down to make some cakes for Amulya when the Bara
"Rani came upon the scene.   Oh dear,  she exclaimed,  has it come"
to this that you must make cakes for your own birthday? 

 Is there no one else for whom I could be making them?   I asked.

 But this is not the day when you should think of feasting
others.  It is for us to feast you.  I was just thinking of
making something up [29] when I heard the staggering news which
"completely upset me.  A gang of five or six hundred men, they"
"say, has raided one of our treasuries and made off with six"
"thousand rupees.  Our house will be looted next, they expect. "

I felt greatly relieved.  So it was our own money after all.  I
wanted to send for Amulya at once and tell him that he need only
hand over those notes to my husband and leave the explanations to
me.

" You are a wonderful creature!   my sister-in-law broke out, at"
the change in my countenance.   Have you then really no such
thing as fear? 

" I cannot believe it,  I said.   Why should they loot our house? "

" Not believe it, indeed!  Who could have believed that they would"
"attack our treasury, either? "

"I made no reply, but bent over my cakes, putting in the cocoa-nut"
stuffing.

" Well, I m off,  said the Bara Rani after a prolonged stare at"
me.   I must see Brother Nikhil and get something done about
"sending off my money to Calcutta, before it s too late. "

She was no sooner gone than I left the cakes to take care of
"themselves and rushed to my dressing-room, shutting myself"
inside.  My husband s tunic with the keys in its pocket was still
hanging there--so forgetful was he.  I took the key of the iron
"safe off the ring and kept it by me, hidden in the folds of my"
dress.

"Then there came a knocking at the door.   I am dressing,  I"
called out.  I could hear the Bara Rani saying:  Only a minute
ago I saw her making cakes and now she is busy dressing up.  What
"next, I wonder!  One of their   Bande Mataram   meetings is"
"on, I suppose.  I say, Robber Queen,  she called out to me,  are"
you taking stock of your loot? 

When they went away I hardly know what made me open the safe.
Perhaps there was a lurking hope that it might all be a dream.
"What if, on pulling out the inside drawer, I should find the"
"rolls of gold there, just as before?  ...  Alas, everything was"
empty as the trust which had been betrayed.

I had to go through the farce of dressing.  I had to do my hair
"up all over again, quite unnecessarily.  When I came out my"
sister-in-law railed at me:  How many times are you going to
dress today? 

 My birthday!   I said.

" Oh, any pretext seems good enough,  she went on.   Many vain"
"people have I seen in my day, but you beat them all hollow. "

"I was about to summon a servant to send after Amulya, when one of"
"the men came up with a little note, which he handed to me.  It"
"was from Amulya.   Sister,  he wrote,  you invited me this"
"afternoon, but I thought I should not wait.  Let me first execute"
your bidding and then come for my   prasad  .  I may be a
little late. 

To whom could he be going to return that money?  into what fresh
"entanglement was the poor boy rushing?  O miserable woman, you"
"can only send him off like an arrow, but not recall him if you"
miss your aim.

I should have declared at once that I was at the bottom of this
robbery.  But women live on the trust of their surroundings--this
is their whole world.  If once it is out that this trust has been
"secretly betrayed, their place in their world is lost.  They have"
"then to stand upon the fragments of the thing they have broken,"
and its jagged edges keep on wounding them at every turn.  To sin
"is easy enough, but to make up for it is above all difficult for"
a woman.

For some time past all easy approaches for communion with my
husband have been closed to me.  How then could I burst on him
with this stupendous news?  He was very late in coming for his
meal today--nearly two o clock.  He was absent-minded and hardly
touched any food.  I had lost even the right to press him to take
a little more.  I had to avert my face to wipe away my tears.

I wanted so badly to say to him:  Do come into our room and rest
awhile; you look so tired.   I had just cleared my throat with a
"little cough, when a servant hurried in to say that the Police"
"Inspector had brought Panchu up to the palace.  My husband, with"
"the shadow on his face deepened, left his meal unfinished and"
went out.

A little later the Bara Rani appeared.   Why did you not send me
word when Brother Nikhil came in?   she complained.   As he was
late I thought I might as well finish my bath in the meantime.
However did he manage to get through his meal so soon? 

" Why, did you want him for anything? "

 What is this about both of you going off to Calcutta tomorrow?
"All I can say is, I am not going to be left here alone.  I should"
"get startled out of my life at every sound, with all these"
dacoits about.  Is it quite settled about your going tomorrow? 

" Yes,  said I, though I had only just now heard it; and though,"
"moreover, I was not at all sure that before tomorrow our history"
might not take such a turn as to make it all one whether we went
"or stayed.  After that, what our home, our life would be like,"
was utterly beyond my ken--it seemed so misty and phantom-like.

In a very few hours now my unseen fate would become visible.  Was
there no one who could keep on postponing the flight of these
"hours, from day to day, and so make them long enough for me to"
"set things right, so far as lay in my power?  The time during"
which the seed lies underground is long--so long indeed that one
forgets that there is any danger of its sprouting.  But once its
"shoot shows up above the surface, it grows and grows so fast,"
"there is no time to cover it up, neither with skirt, nor body,"
nor even life itself.

"I will try to think of it no more, but sit quiet--passive and"
callous--let the crash come when it may.  By the day after
"tomorrow all will be over--publicity, laughter, bewailing,"
"questions, explanations--everything."

"But I cannot forget the face of Amulya--beautiful, radiant with"
"devotion.  He did not wait, despairing, for the blow of fate to"
"fall, but rushed into the thick of danger.  In my misery I do him"
reverence.  He is my boy-god.  Under the pretext of his
playfulness he took from me the weight of my burden.  He would
save me by taking the punishment meant for me on his own head.
But how am Ito bear this terrible mercy of my God?

"Oh, my child, my child, I do you reverence.  Little brother mine,"
"I do you reverence.  Pure are you, beautiful are you, I do you"
"reverence.  May you come to my arms, in the next birth, as my own"
child--that is my prayer.

lady of the house herself.  [Trans.].

Rumour became busy on every side.  The police were continually in
and out.  The servants of the house were in a great flurry.

"Khema, my maid, came up to me and said:  Oh, Rani Mother! for"
goodness  sake put away my gold necklace and armlets in your iron
safe.   To whom was I to explain that the Rani herself had been
"weaving all this network of trouble, and had got caught in it,"
too?  I had to play the benign protector and take charge of
"Khema s ornaments and Thako s savings.  The milk-woman, in her"
"turn, brought along and kept in my room a box in which were a"
Benares   sari   and some other of her valued possessions.   I
"got these at your wedding,  she told me."

"When, tomorrow, my iron safe will be opened in the presence of"
"these--Khema, Thako, the milk-woman and all the rest ...  Let me"
not think of it!  Let me rather try to think what it will be like
when this third day of Magh comes round again after a year has
passed.  Will all the wounds of my home life then be still as
fresh as ever?  ...

Amulya writes that he will come later in the evening.  I cannot
"remain alone with my thoughts, doing nothing.  So I sit down"
again to make cakes for him.  I have finished making quite a
"quantity, but still I must go on.  Who will eat them?  I shall"
distribute them amongst the servants.  I must do so this very
night.  Tonight is my limit.  Tomorrow will not be in my hands.

"I went on untiringly, frying cake after cake.  Every now and then"
it seemed to me that there was some noise in the direction of my
"rooms, upstairs.  Could it be that my husband had missed the key"
"of the safe, and the Bara Rani had assembled all the servants to"
"help him to hunt for it?  No, I must not pay heed to these"
sounds.  Let me shut the door.

"I rose to do so, when Thako came panting in:  Rani Mother, oh,"
Rani Mother! 

" Oh get away!   I snapped out, cutting her short.   Don t come"
bothering me. 

" The Bara Rani Mother wants you,  she went on.   Her nephew has"
brought such a wonderful machine from Calcutta.  It talks like a
man.  Do come and hear it! 

"I did not know whether to laugh or to cry.  So, of all things, a"
"gramophone needs must come on the scene at such a time, repeating"
at every winding the nasal twang of its theatrical songs!  What a
fearsome thing results when a machine apes a man.

The shades of evening began to fall.  I knew that Amulya would
not delay to announce himself--yet I could not wait.  I summone
d a servant and said:  Go and tell Amulya Babu to come straight
in here.   The man came back after a while to say that Amulya was
not in--he had not come back since he had gone.

 Gone!   The last word struck my ears like a wail in the
gathering darkness.  Amulya gone!  Had he then come like a streak
"of light from the setting sun, only to be gone for ever?  All"
kinds of possible and impossible dangers flitted through my mind.
It was I who had sent him to his death.  What if he was fearless?
That only showed his own greatness of heart.  But after this how
was Ito go on living all by myself?

I had no memento of Amulya save that pistol--his reverence-
offering.  It seemed to me that this was a sign given by
Providence.  This guilt which had contaminated my life at its
very root--my God in the form of a child had left with me the
"means of wiping it away, and then vanished.  Oh the loving gift--"
the saving grave that lay hidden within it!

"I opened my box and took out the pistol, lifting it reverently to"
my forehead.  At that moment the gongs clanged out from the
temple attached to our house.  I prostrated myself in salutation.

In the evening I feasted the whole household with my cakes.   You
have managed a wonderful birthday feast--and all by yourself
too!   exclaimed my sister-in-law.   But you must leave something
for us to do.   With this she turned on her gramophone and let
loose the shrill treble of the Calcutta actresses all over the
place.  It seemed like a stable full of neighing fillies.

It got quite late before the feasting was over.  I had a sudden
longing to end my birthday celebration by taking the dust of my
husband s feet.  I went up to the bedroom and found him fast
"asleep.  He had had such a worrying, trying day.  I raised the"
"edge of the mosquito curtain very very gently, and laid my head"
"near his feet.  My hair must have touched him, for he moved his"
legs in his sleep and pushed my head away.

I then went out and sat in the west verandah.  A silk-cotton
"tree, which had shed all its leaves, stood there in the distance,"
like a skeleton.  Behind it the crescent moon was setting.  All
of a sudden I had the feeling that the very stars in the sky were
afraid of me--that the whole of the night world was looking
askance at me.  Why?  Because I was alone.

There is nothing so strange in creation as the man who is alone.
"Even he whose near ones have all died, one by one, is not alone--"
companionship comes for him from behind the screen of death.  But
"he, whose kin are there, yet no longer near, who has dropped out"
of all the varied companionship of a full home--the starry
universe itself seems to bristle to look on him in his darkness.

"Where I am, I am not.  I am far away from those who are around"
"me.  I live and move upon a world-wide chasm of separation,"
unstable as the dew-drop upon the lotus leaf.

Why do not men change wholly when they change?  When I look into
"my heart, I find everything that was there, still there--only"
they are topsy-turvy.  Things that were well-ordered have become
jumbled up.  The gems that were strung into a necklace are now
rolling in the dust.  And so my heart is breaking.

I feel I want to die.  Yet in my heart everything still lives--
"nor even in death can I see the end of it all: rather, in death"
there seems to be ever so much more of repining.  What is to be
ended must be ended in this life--there is no other way out.

"Oh forgive me just once, only this time, Lord!  All that you gave"
"into my hands as the wealth of my life, I have made into my"
"burden.  I can neither bear it longer, nor give it up.  O Lord,"
"sound once again those flute strains which you played for me,"
"long ago, standing at the rosy edge of my morning sky--and let"
all my complexities become simple and easy.  Nothing save the
"music of your flute can make whole that which has been broken,"
and pure that which has been sullied.  Create my home anew with
your music.  No other way can I see.

I threw myself prone on the ground and sobbed aloud.  It was for
"mercy that I prayed--some little mercy from somewhere, some"
"shelter, some sign of forgiveness, some hope that might bring"
"about the end.   Lord,  I vowed to myself,  I will lie here,"
"waiting and waiting, touching neither food nor drink, so long as"
your blessing does not reach me. 

I heard the sound of footsteps.  Who says that the gods do not
show themselves to mortal men?  I did not raise my face to look
"up, lest the sight of it should break the spell.  Come, oh come,"
"come and let your feet touch my head.  Come, Lord, and set your"
"foot upon my throbbing heart, and at that moment let me die."

He came and sat near my head.  Who?  My husband!  At the first
touch of his presence I felt that I should swoon.  And then the
pain at my heart burst its way out in an overwhelming flood of
"tears, tearing through all my obstructing veins and nerves.  I"
"strained his feet to my bosom--oh, why could not their impress"
remain there for ever?

He tenderly stroked my head.  I received his blessing.  Now I
shall be able to take up the penalty of public humiliation which
"will be mine tomorrow, and offer it, in all sincerity, at the"
feet of my God.

But what keeps crushing my heart is the thought that the festive
"flutes which were played at my wedding, nine years ago, welcoming"
"me to this house, will never sound for me again in this life."
What rigour of penance is there which can serve to bring me once
"more, as a bride adorned for her husband, to my place upon that"
"same bridal seat?  How many years, how many ages, aeons, must"
pass before I can find my way back to that day of nine years ago?

"God can create new things, but has even He the power to create"
afresh that which has been destroyed?



Chapter Twelve

Nikhil s Story

XV



TODAY we are going to Calcutta.  Our joys and sorrows lie heavy
on us if we merely go on accumulating them.  Keeping them and
accumulating them alike are false.  As master of the house I am
in an artificial position--in reality I am a wayfarer on the path
of life.  That is why the true Master of the House gets hurt at
every step and at last there comes the supreme hurt of death.

"My union with you, my love, was only of the wayside; it was well"
enough so long as we followed the same road; it will only hamper
us if we try to preserve it further.  We are now leaving its
"bonds behind.  We are started on our journey beyond, and it will"
"be enough if we can throw each other a glance, or feel the touch"
of each other s hands in passing.  After that?  After that there
"is the larger world-path, the endless current of universal life."

"How little can you deprive me of, my love, after all?  Whenever I"
"set my ear to it, I can hear the flute which is playing, its"
fountain of melody gushing forth from the flute-stops of
separation.  The immortal draught of the goddess is never
"exhausted.  She sometimes breaks the bowl from which we drink it,"
only to smile at seeing us so disconsolate over the trifling
loss.  I will not stop to pick up my broken bowl.  I will march
"forward, albeit with unsatisfied heart."

"The Bara Rani came and asked me:  What is the meaning, brother,"
of all these books being packed up and sent off in box-loads? 

" It only means,  I replied,  that I have not yet been able to get"
over my fondness for them. 

 I only wish you would keep your fondness for some other things
as well!  Do you mean you are never coming back home? 

" I shall be coming and going, but shall not immure myself here"
any more. 

 Oh indeed!  Then just come along to my room and see how many
things   I   have been unable to shake off   my   fondness
for.   With this she took me by the hand and marched me off.

In my sister-in-law s rooms I found numberless boxes and bundles
"ready packed.  She opened one of the boxes and said:  See,"
"brother, look at all my   pan  -making things.  In this bottle"
I have catechu powder scented with the pollen of screw-pine
blossoms.  These little tin boxes are all for different kinds of
spices.  I have not forgotten my playing cards and draught-board
"either.  If you two are over-busy, I shall manage to make other"
"friends there, who will give me a game.  Do you remember this"
comb?  It was one of the   Swadeshi   combs you brought for
me... 

" But what is all this for, Sister Rani?  Why have you been"
packing up all these things? 

 Do you think I am not going with you? 

 What an extraordinary idea! 

" Don t you be afraid!  I am not going there to flirt with you,"
nor to quarrel with the Chota Rani!  One must die sooner or
"later, and it is just as well to be on the bank of the holy"
Ganges before it is too late.  It is too horrible to think of
"being cremated in your wretched burning-ground here, under that"
"stumpy banian tree--that is why I have been refusing to die, and"
have plagued you all this time. 

At last I could hear the true voice of home.  The Bara Rani came
"into our house as its bride, when I was only six years old.  We"
"have played together, through the drowsy afternoons, in a corner"
of the roof-terrace.  I have thrown down to her green amras from
"the tree-top, to be made into deliciously indigestible chutnies"
"by slicing them up with mustard, salt and fragrant herbs.  It was"
my part to gather for her all the forbidden things from the
store-room to be used in the marriage celebration of her doll;
"for, in the penal code of my grandmother, I alone was exempt from"
punishment.  And I used to be appointed her messenger to my
"brother, whenever she wanted to coax something special out of"
"him, because he could not resist my importunity.  I also remember"
"how, when I suffered under the rigorous rgime of the doctors of"
those days--who would not allow anything except warm water and
sugared cardamom seeds during feverish attacks--my sister-in-law
could not bear my privation and used to bring me delicacies on
the sly.  What a scolding she got one day when she was caught!

"And then, as we grew up, our mutual joys and sorrows took on"
deeper tones of intimacy.  How we quarrelled!  Sometimes
"conflicts of worldly interests roused suspicions and jealousies,"
making breaches in our love; and when the Chota Rani came in
"between us, these breaches seemed as if they would never be"
"mended, but it always turned out that the healing forces at"
bottom proved more powerful than the wounds on the surface.

"So has a true relationship grown up between us, from our"
"childhood up till now, and its branching foliage has spread and"
broadened over every room and verandah and terrace of this great
"house.  When I saw the Bara Rani make ready, with all her"
"belongings, to depart from this house of ours, all the ties that"
"bound us, to their wide-spreading ends, felt the shock."

"The reason was clear to me, why she had made up her mind to drift"
"away towards the unknown, cutting asunder all her lifelong bonds"
"of daily habit, and of the house itself, which she had never left"
for a day since she first entered it at the age of nine.  And yet
it was this real reason which she could not allow to escape her
"lips, preferring rather to put forward any other paltry excuse."

"She had only this one relationship left in all the world, and the"
"poor, unfortunate, widowed and childless woman had cherished it"
with all the tenderness hoarded in her heart.  How deeply she had
felt our proposed separation I never realized so keenly as when I
stood amongst her scattered boxes and bundles.

I could see at once that the little differences she used to have
"with Bimala, about money matters, did not proceed from any sordid"
"worldliness, but because she felt that her claims in regard to"
this one relationship of her life had been overridden and its
ties weakened for her by the coming in between of this other
woman from goodness knows where!  She had been hurt at every turn
and yet had not the right to complain.

And Bimala?  She also had felt that the Senior Rani s claim over
"me was not based merely on our social connection, but went much"
"deeper; and she was jealous of these ties between us, reaching"
back to our childhood.

Today my heart knocked heavily against the doors of my breast.  I
"sank down upon one of the boxes as I said:  How I should love,"
"Sister Rani, to go back to the days when we first met in this old"
house of ours. 

" No, brother dear,  she replied with a sigh,  I would not live my"
life again--not as a woman!  Let what I have had to bear end with
this one birth.  I could not bear it over again. 

I said to her:  The freedom to which we pass through sorrow is
greater than the sorrow. 

 That may be so for you men.  Freedom is for you.  But we women
would keep others bound.  We would rather be put into bondage
"ourselves.  No, no, brother, you will never get free from our"
"toils.  If you needs must spread your wings, you will have to"
take us with you; we refuse to be left behind.  That is why I
have gathered together all this weight of luggage.  It would
never do to allow men to run too light. 

" I can feel the weight of your words,  I said laughing,  and if"
"we men do not complain of your burdens, it is because women pay"
us so handsomely for what they make us carry. 

" You carry it,  she said,  because it is made up of many small"
things.  Whichever one you think of rejecting pleads that it is
so light.  And so with much lightness we weigh you down ...  When
do we start? 

 The train leaves at half past eleven tonight.  There will be
lots of time. 

" Look here, do be good for once and listen to just one word of"
mine.  Take a good nap this afternoon.  You know you never get
"any sleep in the train.  You look so pulled down, you might go to"
"pieces any moment.  Come along, get through your bath first. "

"As we went towards my room, Khema, the maid, came up and with an"
"ultra-modest pull at her veil told us, in deprecatingly low"
"tones, that the Police Inspector had arrived with a prisoner and"
wanted to see the Maharaja.

" Is the Maharaja a thief, or a robber,  the Bara Rani flared up,"
 that he should be set upon so by the police?  Go and tell the
Inspector that the Maharaja is at his bath. 

" Let me just go and see what is the matter,  I pleaded.   It may"
be something urgent. 

" No, no,  my sister-in-law insisted.   Our Chota Rani was making"
"a heap of cakes last night.  I ll send some to the Inspector, to"
keep him quiet till you re ready.   With this she pushed me into
my room and shut the door on me.

I had not the power to resist such tyranny--so rare is it in this
world.  Let the Inspector while away the time eating cakes.  What
if business is a bit neglected?

The police had been in great form these last few days arresting
"now this one, now that.  Each day some innocent person or other"
would be brought along to enliven the assembly in my office-room.
"One more such unfortunate, I supposed, must have been brought in"
that day.  But why should the Inspector alone be regaled with
cakes?  That would not do at all.  I thumped vigorously on the
door.

" If you are going mad, be quick and pour some water over your"
"head--that will keep you cool,  said my sister-in-law from the"
passage.

" Send down cakes for two,  I shouted.   The person who has been"
brought in as the thief probably deserves them better.  Tell the
man to give him a good big helping. 

"I hurried through my bath.  When I came out, I found Bimal"
sitting on the floor outside.  [30] Could this be my Bimal of
"old, my proud, sensitive Bimal?"

"What favour could she be wanting to beg, seated like this at my"
door?

"As I stopped short, she stood up and said gently with downcast"
eyes:  I would have a word with you. 

" Come inside then,  I said."

 But are you going out on any particular business? 

" I was, but let that be.  I want to hear ... "

" No, finish your business first.  We will have our talk after you"
have had your dinner. 

"I went off to my sitting-room, to find the Police Inspector s"
"plate quite empty.  The person he had brought with him, however,"
was still busy eating.

" Hullo!   I ejaculated in surprise.   You, Amulya? "

" It is I, sir,  said Amulya with his mouth full of cake.   I ve"
"had quite a feast.  And if you don t mind, I ll take the rest"
with me.   With this he proceeded to tie up the remaining cakes
in his handkerchief.

" What does this mean?   I asked, staring at the Inspector."

"The man laughed.   We are no nearer, sir,  he said,  to solving"
the problem of the thief: meanwhile the mystery of the theft
"deepens.   He then produced something tied up in a rag, which"
"when untied disclosed a bundle of currency notes.   This,"
"Maharaja,  said the Inspector,  is your six thousand rupees! "

 Where was it found? 

 In Amulya Babu s hands.  He went last evening to the manager of
your Chakna sub-office to tell him that the money had been found.
The manager seemed to be in a greater state of trepidation at the
recovery than he had been at the robbery.  He was afraid he would
be suspected of having made away with the notes and of now making
up a cock-and-bull story for fear of being found out.  He asked
"Amulya to wait, on the pretext of getting him some refreshment,"
"and came straight over to the Police Office.  I rode off at once,"
"kept Amulya with me, and have been busy with him the whole"
morning.  He refuses to tell us where he got the money from.  I
warned him he would be kept under restraint till he did so.  In
"that case, he informed me he would have to lie.  Very well, I"
"said, he might do so if he pleased.  Then he stated that he had"
found the money under a bush.  I pointed out to him that it was
not quite so easy to lie as all that.  Under what bush?  Where
was the place?  Why was he there?--All this would have to be
"stated as well.   Don t you worry,  he said,  there is plenty of"
time to invent all that.  

" But, Inspector,  I said,  why are you badgering a respectable"
young gentleman like Amulya Babu? 

" I have no desire to harass him,  said the Inspector.   He is not"
"only a gentleman, but the son of Nibaran Babu, my school-fellow."
"Let me tell you, Maharaja, exactly what must have happened."
"Amulya knows the thief, but wants to shield him by drawing"
suspicion on himself.  That is just the sort of bravado he loves
"to indulge in.   The Inspector turned to Amulya.   Look here,"
"young man,  he continued,  I also was eighteen once upon a time,"
and a student in the Ripon College.  I nearly got into gaol
trying to rescue a hack driver from a police constable.  It was a
"near shave.   Then he turned again to me and said:  Maharaja, the"
"real thief will now probably escape, but I think I can tell you"
who is at the bottom of it all. 

" Who is it, then?   I asked."

" The manager, in collusion with the guard, Kasim. "

"When the Inspector, having argued out his theory to his own"
"satisfaction, at last departed, I said to Amulya:  If you will"
"tell me who took the money, I promise you no one shall be hurt. "

" I did,  said he."

 But how can that be?  What about the gang of armed men?... 

" It was I, by myself, alone! "

What Amulya then told me was indeed extraordinary.  The manager
had just finished his supper and was on the verandah rinsing out
his mouth.  The place was somewhat dark.  Amulya had a revolver
"in each pocket, one loaded with blank cartridges, the other with"
ball.  He had a mask over his face.  He flashed a bull s-eye
lantern in the manager s face and fired a blank shot.  The man
"swooned away.  Some of the guards, who were off duty, came"
"running up, but when Amulya fired another blank shot at them they"
"lost no time in taking cover.  Then Kasim, who was on duty, came"
up whirling a quarterstaff.  This time Amulya aimed a bullet at
"his legs, and finding himself hit, Kasim collapsed on the floor."
"Amulya then made the trembling manager, who had come to his"
"senses, open the safe and deliver up six thousand rupees."
"Finally, he took one of the estate horses and galloped off a few"
"miles, there let the animal loose, and quietly walked up here, to"
our place.

" What made you do all this, Amulya?   I asked."

" There was a grave reason, Maharaja,  he replied."

" But why, then, did you try to return the money? "

" Let her come, at whose command I did so.  In her presence I"
shall make a clean breast of it. 

 And who may  she  be? 

" My sister, the Chota Rani! "

"I sent for Bimala.  She came hesitatingly, barefoot, with a white"
shawl over her head.  I had never seen my Bimal like this before.
She seemed to have wrapped herself in a morning light.

Amulya prostrated himself in salutation and took the dust of her
"feet.  Then, as he rose, he said:  Your command has been"
"executed, sister.  The money is returned. "

" You have saved me, my little brother,  said Bimal."

" With your image in my mind, I have not uttered a single lie, "
Amulya continued.   My watchword   Bande Mataram   has been
"cast away at your feet for good.  I have also received my reward,"
"your   prasad  , as soon as I came to the palace. "

"Bimal looked at him blankly, unable to follow his last words."
"Amulya brought out his handkerchief, and untying it showed her"
"the cakes put away inside.   I did not eat them all,  he said."
 I have kept these to eat after you have helped me with your own
hands. 

I could see that I was not wanted here.  I went out of the room.
"I could only preach and preach, so I mused, and get my effigy"
burnt for my pains.  I had not yet been able to bring back a
"single soul from the path of death.  They who have the power, can"
do so by a mere sign.  My words have not that ineffable meaning.
"I am not a flame, only a black coal, which has gone out.  I can"
light no lamp.  That is what the story of my life shows--my row
of lamps has remained unlit.

------

"30. Sitting on the bare floor is a sign of mourning, and so, by"
"association of ideas, of an abject attitude of mind.  [Trans.]."

XVI



I returned slowly towards the inner apartments.  The Bara Rani s
room must have been drawing me again.  It had become an absolute
"necessity for me, that day, to feel that this life of mine had"
"been able to strike some real, some responsive chord in some"
other harp of life.  One cannot realize one s own existence by
remaining within oneself--it has to be sought outside.

"As I passed in front of my sister-in-law s room, she came out"
saying:  I was afraid you would be late again this afternoon.
However.  I ordered your dinner as soon as I heard you coming.
It will be served in a minute. 

" Meanwhile,  I said;  let me take out that money of yours and"
have it kept ready to take with us. 

As we walked on towards my room she asked me if the Police
Inspector had made any report about the robbery.  I somehow did
not feel inclined to tell her all the details of how that six
thousand had come back.   That s just what all the fuss is
"about,  I said evasively."

"When I went into my dressing-room and took out my bunch of keys,"
I did not find the key of the iron safe on the ring.  What an
"absurdly absent-minded fellow I was, to be sure!  Only this"
"morning I had been opening so many boxes and things, and never"
noticed that this key was not there.

 What has happened to your key?   she asked me.

"I went on fumbling in this pocket and that, but could give her no"
answer.  I hunted in the same place over and over again.  It
dawned on both of us that it could not be a case of the key being
mislaid.  Someone must have taken it off the ring.  Who could it
be?  Who else could have come into this room?

" Don t you worry about it,  she said to me.   Get through your"
"dinner first.  The Chota Rani must have kept it herself, seeing"
how absent-minded you are getting. 

"I was, however, greatly disturbed.  It was never Bimal s habit to"
take any key of mine without telling me about it.  Bimal was not
present at my meal-time that day: she was busy feasting Amulya in
"her own room.  My sister-in-law wanted to send for her, but I"
asked her not to do so.

I had just finished my dinner when Bimal came in.  I would have
preferred not to discuss the matter of the key in the Bara Rani s
"presence, but as soon as she saw Bimal, she asked her:  Do you"
"know, dear, where the key of the safe is? "

" I have it,  was the reply."

 Didn t I say so!   exclaimed my sister-in-law triumphantly.
" Our Chota Rani pretends not to care about these robberies, but"
"she takes precautions on the sly, all the same. "

The look on Bimal s face made my mind misgive me.   Let the key
"be, now,  I said.   I will take out that money in the evening. "

" There you go again, putting it off,  said the Bara Rani.   Why"
not take it out and send it to the treasury while you have it in
mind? 

" I have taken it out already,  said Bimal."

I was startled.

" Where have you kept it, then?   asked my sister-in-law."

 I have spent it. 

 Just listen to her!  Whatever did you spend all that money on? 

Bimal made no reply.  I asked her nothing further.  The Bara Rani
"seemed about to make some further remark to Bimala, but checked"
"herself.   Well, that is all right, anyway,  she said at length,"
as she looked towards me.   Just what I used to do with my
husband s loose cash.  I knew it was no use leaving it with him--
his hundred and one hangers-on would be sure to get hold of it.
"You are much the same, dear!  What a number of ways you men know"
of getting through money.  We can only save it from you by
stealing it ourselves!  Come along now.  Off with you to bed. 

"The Bara Rani led me to my room, but I hardly knew where I was"
"going.  She sat by my bed after I was stretched on it, and smiled"
"at Bimal as she said:  Give me one of your pans, Chotie darling--"
what?  You have none!  You have become a regular mem-sahib.  Then
send for some from my room. 

 But have you had your dinner yet?   I anxiously enquired.

" Oh long ago,  she replied--clearly a fib."

"She kept on chattering away there at my bedside, on all manner of"
things.  The maid came and told Bimal that her dinner had been
"served and was getting cold, but she gave no sign of having heard"
it.   Not had your dinner yet?  What nonsense!  It s fearfully
late.   With this the Bara Rani took Bimal away with her.

I could divine that there was some connection between the taking
out of this six thousand and the robbing of the other.  But I
have no curiosity to learn the nature of it.  I shall never ask.

Providence leaves our life moulded in the rough--its object being
"that we ourselves should put the finishing touches, shaping it"
into its final form to our taste.  There has always been the
hankering within me to express some great idea in the process of
giving shape to my life on the lines suggested by the Creator.
In this endeavour I have spent all my days.  How severely I have
"curbed my desires, repressed myself at every step, only the"
Searcher of the Heart knows.

"But the difficulty is, that one s life is not solely one s own."
He who would create it must do so with the help of his
"surroundings, or he will fail.  So it was my constant dream to"
draw Bimal to join me in this work of creating myself.  I loved
"her with all my soul; on the strength of that, I could not but"
succeed in winning her to my purpose--that was my firm belief.

Then I discovered that those who could simply and naturally draw
their environment into the process of their self-creation
"belonged to one species of the genus  man ,--and I to another.  I"
"had received the vital spark, but could not impart it.  Those to"
"whom I have surrendered my all have taken my all, but not myself"
with it.

"My trial is hard indeed.  Just when I want a helpmate most, I am"
"thrown back on myself alone.  Nevertheless, I record my vow that"
"even in this trial I shall win through.  Alone, then, shall I"
tread my thorny path to the end of this life s journey ...

I have begun to suspect that there has all along been a vein of
tyranny in me.  There was a despotism in my desire to mould my
"relations with Bimala in a hard, clear-cut, perfect form.  But"
man s life was not meant to be cast in a mould.  And if we try to
"shape the good, as so much mere material, it takes a terrible"
revenge by losing its life.

I did not realize all this while that it must have been this
unconscious tyranny of mine which made us gradually drift apart.
"Bimala s life, not finding its true level by reason of my"
"pressure from above, has had to find an outlet by undermining its"
banks at the bottom.  She has had to steal this six thousand
"rupees because she could not be open with me, because she felt"
"that, in certain things, I despotically differed from her."

"Men, such as I, possessed with one idea, are indeed at one with"
"those who can manage to agree with us; but those who do not, can"
only get on with us by cheating us.  It is our unyielding
"obstinacy, which drives even the simplest to tortuous ways.  In"
"trying to manufacture a helpmate, we spoil a wife."

"Could I not go back to the beginning?  Then, indeed, I should"
follow the path of the simple.  I should not try to fetter my
"life s companion with my ideas, but play the joyous pipes of my"
love and say:  Do you love me?  Then may you grow true to
yourself in the light of your love.  Let my suggestions be
"suppressed, let God s design, which is in you, triumph, and my"
ideas retire abashed. 

"But can even Nature s nursing heal the open wound, into which our"
"accumulated differences have broken out?  The covering veil,"
beneath the privacy of which Nature s silent forces alone can
"work, has been torn asunder.  Wounds must be bandaged--can we not"
"bandage our wound with our love, so that the day may come when"
its scar will no longer be visible?  It is not too late?  So much
time has been lost in misunderstanding; it has taken right up to
now to come to an understanding; how much more time will it take
for the correcting?  What if the wound does eventually heal?--can
the devastation it has wrought ever be made good?

There was a slight sound near the door.  As I turned over I saw
Bimala s retreating figure through the open doorway.  She must
"have been waiting by the door, hesitating whether to come in or"
"not, and at last have decided to go back.  I jumped up and"
"bounded to the door, calling:  Bimal. "

She stopped on her way.  She had her back to me.  I went and took
her by the hand and led her into our room.  She threw herself
"face downwards on a pillow, and sobbed and sobbed.  I said"
"nothing, but held her hand as I sat by her head."

When her storm of grief had abated she sat up.  I tried to draw
"her to my breast, but she pushed my arms away and knelt at my"
"feet, touching them repeatedly with her head, in obeisance.  I"
"hastily drew my feet back, but she clasped them in her arms,"
"saying in a choking voice:  No, no, no, you must not take away"
your feet.  Let me do my worship. 

I kept still.  Who was I to stop her?  Was I the god of her
worship that I should have any qualms?



Bimala s Story

XXIII



"Come, come!  Now is the time to set sail towards that great"
"confluence, where the river of love meets the sea of worship.  In"
that pure blue all the weight of its muddiness sinks and
disappears.

"I now fear nothing--neither myself, nor anybody else.  I have"
passed through fire.  What was inflammable has been burnt to
ashes; what is left is deathless.  I have dedicated myself to the
"feet of him, who has received all my sin into the depths of his"
own pain.

Tonight we go to Calcutta.  My inward troubles have so long
prevented my looking after my things.  Now let me arrange and
pack them.

After a while I found my husband had come in and was taking a
hand in the packing.

" This won t do,  I said.   Did you not promise me you would have"
a sleep? 

" I might have made the promise,  he replied,  but my sleep did"
"not, and it was nowhere to be found. "

" No, no,  I repeated,  this will never do.  Lie down for a while,"
at least. 

 But how can you get through all this alone? 

 Of course I can. 

" Well, you may boast of being able to do without me.  But frankly"
"I can t do without you.  Even sleep refused to come to me, alone,"
in that room.   Then he set to work again.

"But there was an interruption, in the shape of a servant, who"
came and said that Sandip Babu had called and had asked to be
announced.  I did not dare to ask whom he wanted.  The light of
"the sky seemed suddenly to be shut down, like the leaves of a"
sensitive plant.

" Come, Bimal,  said my husband.   Let us go and hear what Sandip"
"has to tell us.  Since he has come back again, after taking his"
"leave, he must have something special to say. "

"I went, simply because it would have been still more embarrassing"
to stay.  Sandip was staring at a picture on the wall.  As we
entered he said:  You must be wondering why the fellow has
returned.  But you know the ghost is never laid till all the
rites are complete.   With these words he brought out of his
"pocket something tied in his handkerchief, and laying it on the"
"table, undid the knot.  It was those sovereigns."

" Don t you mistake me, Nikhil,  he said.   You must not imagine"
that the contagion of your company has suddenly turned me honest;
I am not the man to come back in slobbering repentance to return
ill-gotten money.  But... 

He left his speech unfinished.  After a pause he turned towards
"Nikhil, but said to me:  After all these days, Queen Bee, the"
ghost of compunction has found an entry into my hitherto
"untroubled conscience.  As I have to wrestle with it every night,"
"after my first sleep is over, I cannot call it a phantom of my"
imagination.  There is no escape even for me till its debt is
"paid.  Into the hands of that spirit, therefore, let me make"
"restitution.  Goddess!  From you, alone, of all the world, I"
shall not be able to take away anything.  I shall not be rid of
you till I am destitute.  Take these back! 

He took out at the same time the jewel-casket from under his
"tunic and put it down, and then left us with hasty steps."

" Listen to me, Sandip,  my husband called after him."

" I have not the time, Nikhil,  said Sandip as he paused near the"
"door.   The Mussulmans, I am told, have taken me for an"
"invaluable gem, and are conspiring to loot me and hide me away in"
their graveyard.  But I feel that it is necessary that I should
live.  I have just twenty-five minutes to catch the North-bound
"train.  So, for the present, I must be gone.  We shall have our"
talk out at the next convenient opportunity.  If you take my
"advice, don t you delay in getting away either.  I salute you,"
"Queen Bee, Queen of the bleeding hearts, Queen of desolation! "

Sandip then left almost at a run.  I stood stock-still; I had
"never realized in such a manner before, how trivial, how paltry,"
this gold and these jewels were.  Only a short while ago I was so
"busy thinking what I should take with me, and how I should pack"
it.  Now I felt that there was no need to take anything at all.
To set out and go forth was the important thing.

My husband left his seat and came up and took me by the hand.
" It is getting late,  he said.   There is not much time left to"
complete our preparations for the journey. 

At this point Chandranath Babu suddenly came in.  Finding us both
"together, he fell back for a moment.  Then he said,  Forgive me,"
"my little mother, if I intrude.  Nikhil, the Mussulmans are out"
of hand.  They are looting Harish Kundu s treasury.  That does
not so much matter.  But what is intolerable is the violence that
is being done to the women of their house. 

" I am off,  said my husband."

" What can you do there?   I pleaded, as I held him by the hand."
" Oh, sir,  I appealed to his master.   Will you not tell him not"
to go? 

" My little mother,  he replied,  there is no time to do anything"
else. 

" Don t be alarmed, Bimal,  said my husband, as he left us."

When I went to the window I saw my husband galloping away on
"horseback, with not a weapon in his hands."

In another minute the Bara Rani came running in.   What have you
"done, Chotie darling,  she cried.   How could you let him go? "

" Call the Dewan at once,  she said, turning to a servant."

"The Ranis never appeared before the Dewan, but the Bara Rani had"
no thought that day for appearances.

" Send a mounted man to bring back the Maharaja at once,  she"
"said, as soon as the Dewan came up."

" We have all entreated him to stay, Rani Mother,  said the Dewan,"
 but he refused to turn back. 

" Send word to him that the Bara Rani is ill, that she is on her"
"death-bed,  cried my sister-in-law wildly."

When the Dewan had left she turned on me with a furious outburst.
" Oh, you witch, you ogress, you could not die yourself, but needs"
must send him to his death!  ... 

The light of the day began to fade.  The sun set behind the
feathery foliage of the blossoming   Sajna   tree.  I can see
every different shade of that sunset even today.  Two masses of
cloud on either side of the sinking orb made it look like a great
bird with fiery-feathered wings outspread.  It seemed to me that
"this fateful day was taking its flight, to cross the ocean of"
night.

It became darker and darker.  Like the flames of a distant
"village on fire, leaping up every now and then above the horizon,"
a distant din swelled up in recurring waves into the darkness.

The bells of the evening worship rang out from our temple.  I
"knew the Bara Rani was sitting there, with palms joined in silent"
prayer.  But I could not move a step from the window.

"The roads, the village beyond, and the still more distant fringe"
"of trees, grew more and more vague.  The lake in our grounds"
"looked up into the sky with a dull lustre, like a blind man s"
eye.  On the left the tower seemed to be craning its neck to
catch sight of something that was happening.

The sounds of night take on all manner of disguises.  A twig
"snaps, and one thinks that somebody is running for his life.  A"
"door slams, and one feels it to be the sudden heart-thump of a"
startled world.

Lights would suddenly flicker under the shade of the distant
"trees, and then go out again.  Horses  hoofs would clatter, now"
"and again, only to turn out to be riders leaving the palace"
gates.

"I continually had the feeling that, if only I could die, all this"
turmoil would come to an end.  So long as I was alive my sins
"would remain rampant, scattering destruction on every side.  I"
remembered the pistol in my box.  But my feet refused to leave
the window in quest of it.  Was I not awaiting my fate?

"The gong of the watch solemnly struck ten.  A little later,"
groups of lights appeared in the distance and a great crowd wound
"its way, like some great serpent, along the roads in the"
"darkness, towards the palace gates."

The Dewan rushed to the gate at the sound.  Just then a rider
"came galloping in.   What s the news, Jata?   asked the Dewan."

" Not good,  was the reply."

I could hear these words distinctly from my window.  But
something was next whispered which I could not catch.

"Then came a palanquin, followed by a litter.  The doctor was"
walking alongside the palanquin.

" What do you think, doctor?   asked the Dewan."

" Can t say yet,  the doctor replied.   The wound in the head is a"
serious one. 

 And Amulya Babu? 

 He has a bullet through the heart.  He is done for.

MASHI


I

'Mashi!'[1]

  [1] The maternal aunt is addressed as Mashi.

"'Try to sleep, Jotin, it is getting late.'"

'Never mind if it is. I have not many days left. I was thinking that
Mani should go to her father's house.--I forget where he is now.'

'Sitarampur.'

'Oh yes! Sitarampur. Send her there. She should not remain any longer
near a sick man. She herself is not strong.'

'Just listen to him! How can she bear to leave you in this state?'

'Does she know what the doctors----?'

'But she can see for herself! The other day she cried her eyes out at
the merest hint of having to go to her father's house.'

We must explain that in this statement there was a slight distortion
"of truth, to say the least of it. The actual talk with Mani was as"
follows:--

                   *       *       *       *       *

"'I suppose, my child, you have got some news from your father? I"
thought I saw your cousin Anath here.'

Yes! Next Friday will be my little sister's  annaprashan [2]
ceremony. So I'm thinking----'

  [2] The  annaprashan  ceremony takes place when a child is first given
  rice. Usually it receives its name on that day.

"'All right, my dear. Send her a gold necklace. It will please your"
mother.'

"'I'm thinking of going myself. I've never seen my little sister, and"
I want to ever so much.'

'Whatever do you mean? You surely don't think of leaving Jotin alone?
Haven't you heard what the doctor says about him?'

'But he said that just now there's no special cause for----'

"'Even if he did, you can see his state.'"

"'This is the first girl after three brothers, and she's a great"
favourite.--I have heard that it's going to be a grand affair. If I
"don't go, mother will be very----'"

"'Yes, yes! I don't understand your mother. But I know very well that"
your father will be angry enough if you leave Jotin just now.'

'You'll have to write a line to him saying that there is no special
"cause for anxiety, and that even if I go, there will be no----'"

'You're right there; it will certainly be no great loss if you do go.
"But remember, if I write to your father, I'll tell him plainly what"
is in my mind.'

"'Then you needn't write. I shall ask my husband, and he will"
surely----'

"'Look here, child, I've borne a good deal from you, but if you do"
"that, I won't stand it for a moment. Your father knows you too well"
for you to deceive him.'

                   *       *       *       *       *

"When Mashi had left her, Mani lay down on her bed in a bad temper."

Her neighbour and friend came and asked what was the matter.

Look here! What a shame it is! Here's my only sister's  annaprashan 
"coming, and they don't want to let me go to it!'"

"'Why! Surely you're never thinking of going, are you, with your"
husband so ill?'

"'I don't do anything for him, and I couldn't if I tried. It's so"
"deadly dull in this house, that I tell you frankly I can't bear it.'"

'You are a strange woman!'

"'But I can't pretend, as you people do, and look glum lest any one"
should think ill of me.'

"'Well, tell me your plan.'"

'I must go. Nobody can prevent me.'

'Isss! What an imperious young woman you are!'


II

Hearing that Mani had wept at the mere thought of going to her father's
"house, Jotin was so excited that he sat up in bed. Pulling his pillow"
"towards him, he leaned back, and said: 'Mashi, open this window a"
"little, and take that lamp away.'"

                   *       *       *       *       *

The still night stood silently at the window like a pilgrim of
"eternity; and the stars gazed in, witnesses through untold ages of"
countless death-scenes.

"Jotin saw his Mani's face traced on the background of the dark night,"
"and saw those two big dark eyes brimming over with tears, as it were"
for all eternity.

"Mashi felt relieved when she saw him so quiet, thinking he was asleep."

"Suddenly he started up, and said: 'Mashi, you all thought that Mani"
was too frivolous ever to be happy in our house. But you see now----'

"'Yes, I see now, my Baba,[3] I was mistaken--but trial tests a"
person.'

"  [3] Baba literally means Father, but is often used by elders as a term"
  of endearment. In the same way 'Ma' is used.

'Mashi!'

"'Do try to sleep, dear!'"

"'Let me think a little, let me talk. Don't be vexed, Mashi!'"

'Very well.'

"'Once, when I used to think I could not win Mani's heart, I bore it"
silently. But you----'

"'No, dear, I won't allow you to say that; I also bore it.'"

"'Our minds, you know, are not clods of earth which you can possess"
"by merely picking up. I felt that Mani did not know her own mind, and"
that one day at some great shock----'

"'Yes, Jotin, you are right.'"

'Therefore I never took much notice of her waywardness.'

"Mashi remained silent, suppressing a sigh. Not once, but often she"
had seen Jotin spending the night on the verandah wet with the
"splashing rain, yet not caring to go into his bedroom. Many a day"
"he lay with a throbbing head, longing, she knew, that Mani would"
"come and soothe his brow, while Mani was getting ready to go to the"
"theatre. Yet when Mashi went to fan him, he sent her away petulantly."
She alone knew what pain lay hidden in that distress. Again and again
she had wanted to say to Jotin: 'Don't pay so much attention to that
"silly child, my dear; let her learn to want,--to cry for things.'"
"But these things cannot be said, and are apt to be misunderstood."
"Jotin had in his heart a shrine set up to the goddess Woman, and"
there Mani had her throne. It was hard for him to imagine that his
own fate was to be denied his share of the wine of love poured out
"by that divinity. Therefore the worship went on, the sacrifice was"
"offered, and the hope of a boon never ceased."

                   *       *       *       *       *

"Mashi imagined once more that Jotin was sleeping, when he cried out"
suddenly:

"'I know you thought that I was not happy with Mani, and therefore you"
"were angry with her. But, Mashi, happiness is like those stars. They"
don't cover all the darkness; there are gaps between. We make mistakes
"in life and we misunderstand, and yet there remain gaps through which"
truth shines. I do not know whence comes this gladness that fills my
heart to-night.'

"Mashi began gently to soothe Jotin's brow, her tears unseen in the dark."

"'I was thinking, Mashi, she's so young! What will she do when I"
am----?'

"'Young, Jotin? She's old enough. I too was young when I lost the idol"
"of my life, only to find him in my heart for ever. Was that any loss,"
"do you think? Besides, is happiness absolutely necessary?'"

"'Mashi, it seems as if just when Mani's heart shows signs of awakening"
I have to----'

"'Don't you worry about that, Jotin. Isn't it enough if her heart"
awakes?'

Suddenly Jotin recollected the words of a village minstrel's song which
he had heard long before:

    O my heart! you woke not when the man of my heart came to my door.
    At the sound of his departing steps you woke up.
"    Oh, you woke up in the dark!"

"'Mashi, what is the time now?'"

'About nine.'

"'So early as that! Why, I thought it must be at least two or three"
"o'clock. My midnight, you know, begins at sundown. But why did you want"
"me to sleep, then?'"

"'Why, you know how late last night you kept awake talking; so to-day"
you must get to sleep early.'

'Is Mani asleep?'

"'Oh no, she's busy making some soup for you.'"

"'You don't mean to say so, Mashi? Does she----?'"

"'Certainly! Why, she prepares all your food, the busy little woman.'"

'I thought perhaps Mani could not----'

'It doesn't take long for a woman to learn such things. With the need
it comes of itself.'

"'The fish soup, that I had in the morning, had such a delicate"
"flavour, I thought you had made it.'"

"'Dear me, no! Surely you don't think Mani would let me do anything"
"for you? Why, she does all your washing herself. She knows you can't"
"bear anything dirty about you. If only you could see your sitting-room,"
how spick and span she keeps it! If I were to let her haunt your
"sick-room, she would wear herself out. But that's what she really wants"
to do.'

"'Is Mani's health, then----?'"

'The doctors think she should not be allowed to visit the sick-room
too often. She's too tender-hearted.'

"'But, Mashi, how do you prevent her from coming?'"

'Because she obeys me implicitly. But still I have constantly to be
giving her news of you.'

                   *       *       *       *       *

The stars glistened in the sky like tear-drops. Jotin bowed his head
"in gratitude to his life that was about to depart, and when Death"
"stretched out his right hand towards him through the darkness, he"
took it in perfect trust.

                   *       *       *       *       *

"Jotin sighed, and, with a slight gesture of impatience, said:"

"'Mashi, if Mani is still awake, then, could I--if only for a----?'"

'Very well! I'll go and call her.'

"'I won't keep her long, only for five minutes. I have something"
particular to tell her.'

"Mashi, sighing, went out to call Mani. Meanwhile Jotin's pulse began"
to beat fast. He knew too well that he had never been able to have an
intimate talk with Mani. The two instruments were tuned differently
"and it was not easy to play them in unison. Again and again, Jotin had"
felt pangs of jealousy on hearing Mani chattering and laughing
"merrily with her girl companions. Jotin blamed only himself,--why"
couldn't he talk irrelevant trifles as they did? Not that he could
"not, for with his men friends he often chatted on all sorts of"
trivialities. But the small talk that suits men is not suitable for
"women. You can hold a philosophical discourse in monologue, ignoring"
"your inattentive audience altogether, but small talk requires the"
"co-operation of at least two. The bagpipes can be played singly, but"
"there must be a pair of cymbals. How often in the evenings had Jotin,"
"when sitting on the open verandah with Mani, made some strained"
"attempts at conversation, only to feel the thread snap. And the very"
silence of the evening felt ashamed. Jotin was certain that Mani
longed to get away. He had even wished earnestly that a third person
"would come. For talking is easy with three, when it is hard for two."

He began to think what he should say when Mani came. But such
manufactured talk would not satisfy him. Jotin felt afraid that this
"five minutes of to-night would be wasted. Yet, for him, there were"
but few moments left for intimate talk.

"'What's this, child, you're not going anywhere, are you?'"

"'Of course, I'm going to Sitarampur.'"

'What do you mean? Who is going to take you?'

'Anath.'

"'Not to-day, my child, some other day.'"

'But the compartment has already been reserved.'

"'What does that matter? That loss can easily be borne. Go to-morrow,"
early in the morning.'

"'Mashi, I don't hold by your inauspicious days. What harm if I do go"
to-day?'

'Jotin wants to have a talk with you.'

'All right! there's still some time. I'll just go and see him.'

'But you mustn't say that you are going.'

"'Very well, I won't tell him, but I shan't be able to stay long."
"To-morrow is my sister's  annaprashan , and I must go to-day.'"

"'Oh, my child! I beg you to listen to me this once. Quiet your mind"
for a while and sit by him. Don't let him see your hurry.'

'What can I do? The train won't wait for me. Anath will be back in
ten minutes. I can sit by him till then.'

"'No, that won't do. I shall never let you go to him in that frame of"
"mind.... Oh, you wretch! the man you are torturing is soon to leave"
"this world; but I warn you, you will remember this day till the end"
of your days! That there is a God! that there is a God! you will some
day understand!'

"'Mashi, you mustn't curse me like that.'"

"'Oh, my darling boy! my darling! why do you go on living longer? There"
"is no end to this sin, yet I cannot check it!'"

                   *       *       *       *       *

"Mashi after delaying a little returned to the sick-room, hoping by"
that time Jotin would be asleep. But Jotin moved in his bed when she
entered. Mashi exclaimed:

'Just look what she has done!'

"'What's happened? Hasn't Mani come? Why have you been so long, Mashi?'"

'I found her weeping bitterly because she had allowed the milk for
"your soup to get burnt! I tried to console her, saying, ""Why, there's"
"more milk to be had!"" But that she could be so careless about the"
preparation of  your  soup made her wild. With great trouble I managed
to pacify her and put her to bed. So I haven't brought her to-day. Let
her sleep it off.'

"Though Jotin was pained when Mani didn't come, yet he felt a certain"
amount of relief. He had half feared that Mani's bodily presence
would do violence to his heart's image of her. Such things had
happened before in his life. And the gladness of the idea that Mani
was miserable at burning  his  milk filled his heart to overflowing.

'Mashi!'

"'What is it, Baba?'"

'I feel quite certain that my days are drawing to a close. But I have
no regrets. Don't grieve for me.'

"'No, dear, I won't grieve. I don't believe that only life is good and"
not death.'

"'Mashi, I tell you truly that death seems sweet.'"

"Jotin, gazing at the dark sky, felt that it was Mani herself who"
was coming to him in Death's guise. She had immortal youth and the
"stars were flowers of blessing, showered upon her dark tresses by"
the hand of the World-Mother. It seemed as if once more he had his
first sight of his bride under the veil of darkness.[4] The immense
"night became filled with the loving gaze of Mani's dark eyes. Mani,"
"the bride of this house, the little girl, became transformed into a"
"world-image,--her throne on the altar of the stars at the confluence"
of life and death. Jotin said to himself with clasped hands: 'At
"last the veil is raised, the covering is rent in this deep darkness."
"Ah, beautiful one! how often have you wrung my heart, but no longer"
shall you forsake me!'

  [4] The bride and the bridegroom see each other's face for the first
  time at the marriage ceremony under a veil thrown over their heads.


IV

"'I'm suffering, Mashi, but nothing like you imagine. It seems to me"
as if my pain were gradually separating itself from my life. Like
"a laden boat, it was so long being towed behind, but the rope has"
"snapped, and now it floats away with all my burdens. Still I can see"
"it, but it is no longer mine.... But, Mashi, I've not seen Mani even"
once for the last two days!'

"'Jotin, let me give you another pillow.'"

"'It almost seems to me, Mashi, that Mani also has left me like that"
laden boat of sorrow which drifts away.'

"'Just sip some pomegranate juice, dear! Your throat must be getting"
dry.'

'I wrote my will yesterday; did I show it to you? I can't recollect.'

"'There's no need to show it to me, Jotin.'"

"'When mother died, I had nothing of my own. You fed me and brought me"
up. Therefore I was saying----'

"'Nonsense, child! I had only this house and a little property. You"
earned the rest.'

'But this house----?'

"'That's nothing. Why, you've added to it so much that it's difficult"
to find out where my house was!'

'I'm sure Mani's love for you is really----'

"'Yes, yes! I know that, Jotin. Now you try to sleep.'"

"'Though I have bequeathed all my property to Mani, it is practically"
"yours, Mashi. She will never disobey you.'"

"'Why are you worrying so much about that, dear?'"

'All I have I owe to you. When you see my will don't think for a
moment that----'

"'What do you mean, Jotin? Do you think I shall mind for a moment"
because you give to Mani what belongs to you? Surely I'm not so mean
as that?'

'But you also will have----'

"'Look here, Jotin, I shall get angry with you. You want to console me"
with money!'

"'Oh, Mashi, how I wish I could give you something better than money!'"

"'That you have done, Jotin!--more than enough. Haven't I had you to"
fill my lonely house? I must have won that great good-fortune in
"many previous births! You have given me so much that now, if my"
"destiny's due is exhausted, I shall not complain. Yes, yes! Give away"
"everything in Mani's name,--your house, your money, your carriage,"
and your land--such burdens are too heavy for me!'

"'Of course I know you have lost your taste for the enjoyments of life,"
but Mani is so young that----'

"'No! you mustn't say that. If you want to leave her your property,"
"it is all right, but as for enjoyment----'"

"'What harm if she does enjoy herself, Mashi?'"

"'No, no, it will be impossible. Her throat will become parched, and"
it will be dust and ashes to her.'

                   *       *       *       *       *

"Jotin remained silent. He could not decide whether it was true or not,"
"and whether it was a matter of regret or otherwise, that the world"
would become distasteful to Mani for want of him. The stars seemed
to whisper in his heart:

"'Indeed it is true. We have been watching for thousands of years, and"
know that all these great preparations for enjoyment are but vanity.'

                   *       *       *       *       *

Jotin sighed and said: 'We cannot leave behind us what is really worth
giving.'

"'It's no trifle you are giving, dearest. I only pray she may have the"
power to know the value of what is given her.'

"'Give me a little more of that pomegranate juice, Mashi, I'm thirsty."
"Did Mani come to me yesterday, I wonder?'"

"'Yes, she came, but you were asleep. She sat by your head, fanning"
"you for a long time, and then went away to get your clothes washed.'"

'How wonderful! I believe I was dreaming that very moment that Mani
"was trying to enter my room. The door was slightly open, and she was"
"pushing against it, but it wouldn't open. But, Mashi, you're going too"
"far,--you ought to let her see that I am dying; otherwise my death will"
be a terrible shock to her.'

"'Baba, let me put this shawl over your feet; they are getting cold.'"

"'No, Mashi, I can't bear anything over me like that.'"

"'Do you know, Jotin, Mani made this shawl for you? When she ought to"
"have been asleep, she was busy at it. It was finished only yesterday.'"

"Jotin took the shawl, and touched it tenderly with his hands. It"
seemed to him that the softness of the wool was Mani's own. Her loving
thoughts had been woven night after night with its threads. It was
"not made merely of wool, but also of her touch. Therefore, when Mashi"
"drew that shawl over his feet, it seemed as if, night after night,"
Mani had been caressing his tired limbs.

"'But, Mashi, I thought Mani didn't know how to knit,--at any rate she"
never liked it.'

'It doesn't take long to learn a thing. Of course I had to teach her.
Then there are a good many mistakes in it.'

'Let there be mistakes; we're not going to send it to the Paris
Exhibition. It will keep my feet warm in spite of its mistakes.'

"Jotin's mind began to picture Mani at her task, blundering and"
"struggling, and yet patiently going on night after night. How sweetly"
pathetic it was! And again he went over the shawl with his caressing
fingers.

"'Mashi, is the doctor downstairs?'"

"'Yes, he will stay here to-night.'"

'But tell him it is useless for him to give me a sleeping draught. It
doesn't bring me real rest and only adds to my pain. Let me remain
"properly awake. Do you know, Mashi, that my wedding took place on the"
night of the full moon in the month of  Baisakh ? To-morrow will be
"that day, and the stars of that very night will be shining in the"
sky. Mani perhaps has forgotten. I want to remind her of it to-day;
just call her to me for a minute or two.... Why do you keep silent?
I suppose the doctor has told you I am so weak that any excitement
"will----but I tell you truly, Mashi, to-night, if I can have only a"
"few minutes' talk with her, there will be no need for any sleeping"
"draughts. Mashi, don't cry like that! I am quite well. To-day my heart"
is full as it has never been in my life before. That's why I want
"to see Mani. No, no, Mashi, I can't bear to see you crying! You have"
been so quiet all these last days. Why are you so troubled to-night?'

"'Oh, Jotin, I thought that I had exhausted all my tears, but I find"
there are plenty left. I can't bear it any longer.'

"'Call Mani. I'll remind her of our wedding night, so that to-morrow"
she may----'

"'I'm going, dear. Shombhu will wait at the door. If you want anything,"
call him.'

"Mashi went to Mani's bedroom and sat down on the floor crying,--'Oh"
"come, come once, you heartless wretch! Keep his last request who has"
given you his all! Don't kill him who is already dying!'

                   *       *       *       *       *

"Jotin hearing the sound of footsteps started up, saying, 'Mani!'"

'I am Shombhu. Did you call me?'

'Ask your mistress to come?'

'Ask whom?'

'Your mistress.'

'She has not yet returned.'

'Returned? From where?'

'From Sitarampur.'

'When did she go?'

'Three days ago.'

"For a moment Jotin felt numb all over, and his head began to swim. He"
"slipped down from the pillows, on which he was reclining, and kicked"
off the woollen shawl that was over his feet.

                   *       *       *       *       *

"When Mashi came back after a long time, Jotin did not mention Mani's"
"name, and Mashi thought he had forgotten all about her."

"Suddenly Jotin cried out: 'Mashi, did I tell you about the dream I"
had the other night?'

'Which dream?'

"'That in which Mani was pushing the door, and the door wouldn't open"
more than an inch. She stood outside unable to enter. Now I know that
Mani has to stand outside my door till the last.'

                   *       *       *       *       *

Mashi kept silent. She realised that the heaven she had been building
"for Jotin out of falsehood had toppled down at last. If sorrow comes,"
"it is best to acknowledge it.--When God strikes, we cannot avoid the"
blow.

"'Mashi, the love I have got from you will last through all my births."
"I have filled this life with it to carry it with me. In the next birth,"
"I am sure you will be born as my daughter, and I shall tend you with"
all my love.'

"'What are you saying, Jotin? Do you mean to say I shall be born again"
as a woman? Why can't you pray that I should come to your arms as a
son?'

"'No, no, not a son! You will come to my house in that wonderful beauty"
which you had when you were young. I can even imagine how I shall
dress you.'

"'Don't talk so much, Jotin, but try to sleep.'"

"'I shall name you ""Lakshmi.""'"

"'But that is an old-fashioned name, Jotin!'"

"'Yes, but you are my old-fashioned Mashi. Come to my house again with"
those beautiful old-fashioned manners.'

'I can't wish that I should come and burden your home with the
misfortune of a girl-child!'

"'Mashi, you think me weak, and are wanting to save me all trouble.'"

"'My child, I am a woman, so I have my weakness. Therefore I have tried"
"all my life to save you from all sorts of trouble,--only to fail.'"

"'Mashi, I have not had time in this life to apply the lessons I have"
learnt. But they will keep for my next birth. I shall show then what a
man is able to do. I have learnt how false it is always to be looking
after oneself.'

"'Whatever you may say, darling, you have never grasped anything for"
"yourself, but given everything to others.'"

"'Mashi, I can boast of one thing at any rate. I have never been a"
"tyrant in my happiness, or tried to enforce my claims by violence."
"Because lies could not content me, I have had to wait long. Perhaps"
"truth will be kind to me at last.--Who is that, Mashi, who is that?'"

"'Where? There's no one there, Jotin!'"

"'Mashi, just go and see in the other room. I thought I----'"

"'No, dear! I don't see anybody.'"

'But it seemed quite clear to me that----'

"'No, Jotin, it's nothing. So keep quiet! The doctor is coming now.'"

"When the doctor entered, he said:"

"'Look here, you mustn't stay near the patient so much, you excite him."
"You go to bed, and my assistant will remain with him.'"

"'No, Mashi, I can't let you go.'"

"'All right, Baba! I will sit quietly in that corner.'"

"'No, no! you must sit by my side. I can't let go your hand, not till"
"the very end. I have been made by your hand, and only from your hand"
shall God take me.'

"'All right,' said the doctor, 'you can remain there. But, Jotin"
"Babu, you must not talk to her. It's time for you to take your"
medicine.'

'Time for my medicine? Nonsense! The time for that is over. To give
medicine now is merely to deceive; besides I am not afraid to die.
"Mashi, Death is busy with his physic; why do you add another nuisance"
"in the shape of a doctor? Send him away, send him away! It is you alone"
"I need now! No one else, none whatever! No more falsehood!'"

"'I protest, as a doctor, this excitement is doing you harm.'"

"'Then go, doctor, don't excite me any more!--Mashi, has he gone?..."
That's good! Now come and take my head in your lap.'

"'All right, dear! Now, Baba, try to sleep!'"

"'No, Mashi, don't ask me to sleep. If I sleep, I shall never wake."
I still need to keep awake a little longer. Don't you hear a sound?
Somebody is coming.'


V

"'Jotin dear, just open your eyes a little. She has come. Look once"
and see!'

'Who has come? A dream?'

"'Not a dream, darling! Mani has come with her father.'"

'Who are you?'

'Can't you see? This is your Mani!'

'Mani? Has that door opened?'

"'Yes, Baba, it is wide open.'"

"No, Mashi, not that shawl! not  that  shawl! That shawl is a fraud!'"

"'It is not a shawl, Jotin! It is our Mani, who has flung herself on"
your feet. Put your hand on her head and bless her. Don't cry like
"that, Mani! There will be time enough for that. Keep quiet now for a"
little.'




THE SKELETON


"In the room next to the one in which we boys used to sleep, there hung"
a human skeleton. In the night it would rattle in the breeze which
played about its bones. In the day these bones were rattled by us.
We were taking lessons in osteology from a student in the Campbell
"Medical School, for our guardians were determined to make us masters"
of all the sciences. How far they succeeded we need not tell those
who know us; and it is better hidden from those who do not.

Many years have passed since then. In the meantime the skeleton has
"vanished from the room, and the science of osteology from our brains,"
leaving no trace behind.

"The other day, our house was crowded with guests, and I had to pass"
"the night in the same old room. In these now unfamiliar surroundings,"
"sleep refused to come, and, as I tossed from side to side, I heard all"
"the hours of the night chimed, one after another, by the church clock"
"near by. At length the lamp in the corner of the room, after some"
"minutes of choking and spluttering, went out altogether. One or two"
"bereavements had recently happened in the family, so the going out"
of the lamp naturally led me to thoughts of death. In the great arena
"of nature, I thought, the light of a lamp losing itself in eternal"
"darkness, and the going out of the light of our little human lives,"
"by day or by night, were much the same thing."

My train of thought recalled to my mind the skeleton. While I was
trying to imagine what the body which had clothed it could have
"been like, it suddenly seemed to me that something was walking"
"round and round my bed, groping along the walls of the room. I could"
hear its rapid breathing. It seemed as if it was searching for
"something which it could not find, and pacing round the room with"
ever-hastier steps. I felt quite sure that this was a mere fancy of
"my sleepless, excited brain; and that the throbbing of the veins in"
my temples was really the sound which seemed like running footsteps.
"Nevertheless, a cold shiver ran all over me. To help to get rid of"
"this hallucination, I called out aloud: 'Who is there?' The footsteps"
"seemed to stop at my bedside, and the reply came: 'It is I. I have"
come to look for that skeleton of mine.'

It seemed absurd to show any fear before the creature of my own
"imagination; so, clutching my pillow a little more tightly, I said"
in a casual sort of way: 'A nice business for this time of night! Of
what use will that skeleton be to you now?'

The reply seemed to come almost from my mosquito-curtain itself.
'What a question! In that skeleton were the bones that encircled
my heart; the youthful charm of my six-and-twenty years bloomed about
it. Should I not desire to see it once more?'

"'Of course,' said I, 'a perfectly reasonable desire. Well, go on"
"with your search, while I try to get a little sleep.'"

Said the voice: 'But I fancy you are lonely. All right; I'll sit down
"a while, and we will have a little chat. Years ago I used to sit by men"
and talk to them. But during the last thirty-five years I have only
moaned in the wind in the burning-places of the dead. I would talk
once more with a man as in the old times.'

I felt that some one sat down just near my curtain. Resigning myself to
"the situation, I replied with as much cordiality as I could summon:"
'That will be very nice indeed. Let us talk of something cheerful.'

'The funniest thing I can think of is my own life-story. Let me tell
you that.'

The church clock chimed the hour of two.

"'When I was in the land of the living, and young, I feared one thing"
"like death itself, and that was my husband. My feelings can be likened"
only to those of a fish caught with a hook. For it was as if a stranger
had snatched me away with the sharpest of hooks from the peaceful
calm of my childhood's home--and from him I had no means of escape.
"My husband died two months after my marriage, and my friends and"
"relations moaned pathetically on my behalf. My husband's father, after"
"scrutinising my face with great care, said to my mother-in-law: ""Do"
"you not see, she has the evil eye?""--Well, are you listening? I hope"
you are enjoying the story?'

'Very much indeed!' said I. 'The beginning is extremely humorous.'

'Let me proceed then. I came back to my father's house in great glee.
"People tried to conceal it from me, but I knew well that I was endowed"
with a rare and radiant beauty. What is your opinion?'

"'Very likely,' I murmured. 'But you must remember that I never saw"
you.'

'What! Not seen me? What about that skeleton of mine? Ha! ha! ha!
Never mind. I was only joking. How can I ever make you believe
"that those two cavernous hollows contained the brightest of dark,"
languishing eyes? And that the smile which was revealed by those ruby
lips had no resemblance whatever to the grinning teeth which you used
"to see? The mere attempt to convey to you some idea of the grace,"
"the charm, the soft, firm, dimpled curves, which in the fulness of"
youth were growing and blossoming over those dry old bones makes me
smile; it also makes me angry. The most eminent doctors of my time
could not have dreamed of the bones of that body of mine as materials
"for teaching osteology. Do you know, one young doctor that I knew of,"
actually compared me to a golden  champak  blossom. It meant that to
him the rest of humankind was fit only to illustrate the science
"of physiology, that I was a flower of beauty. Does any one think of"
the skeleton of a  champak  flower?

"'When I walked, I felt that, like a diamond scattering splendour,"
my every movement set waves of beauty radiating on every side. I used
to spend hours gazing on my hands--hands which could gracefully have
reined the liveliest of male creatures.

'But that stark and staring old skeleton of mine has borne
"false-witness to you against me, while I was unable to refute the"
shameless libel. That is why of all men I hate you most! I feel I
would like once for all to banish sleep from your eyes with a
"vision of that warm rosy loveliness of mine, to sweep out with it"
all the wretched osteological stuff of which your brain is full.'

"'I could have sworn by your body,' cried I, 'if you had it still,"
"that no vestige of osteology has remained in my head, and that the only"
"thing that it is now full of is a radiant vision of perfect loveliness,"
glowing against the black background of night. I cannot say more than
that.'

"'I had no girl-companions,' went on the voice. 'My only brother"
had made up his mind not to marry. In the zenana I was alone. Alone I
"used to sit in the garden under the shade of the trees, and dream"
that the whole world was in love with me; that the stars with sleepless
gaze were drinking in my beauty; that the wind was languishing in
sighs as on some pretext or other it brushed past me; and that the
"lawn on which my feet rested, had it been conscious, would have lost"
consciousness again at their touch. It seemed to me that all the young
"men in the world were as blades of grass at my feet; and my heart, I"
"know not why, used to grow sad."

"'When my brother's friend, Shekhar, had passed out of the Medical"
"College, he became our family doctor. I had already often seen him from"
"behind a curtain. My brother was a strange man, and did not care to"
look on the world with open eyes. It was not empty enough for his
"taste; so he gradually moved away from it, until he was quite lost in"
"an obscure corner. Shekhar was his one friend, so he was the only"
young man I could ever get to see. And when I held my evening court in
"my garden, then the host of imaginary young men whom I had at my feet"
were each one a Shekhar.--Are you listening? What are you thinking of?'

I sighed as I replied: 'I was wishing I was Shekhar!'

"'Wait a bit. Hear the whole story first. One day, in the rains, I"
was feverish. The doctor came to see me. That was our first meeting.
"I was reclining opposite the window, so that the blush of the evening"
"sky might temper the pallor of my complexion. When the doctor, coming"
"in, looked up into my face, I put myself into his place, and gazed"
at myself in imagination. I saw in the glorious evening light that
delicate wan face laid like a drooping flower against the soft white
"pillow, with the unrestrained curls playing over the forehead, and the"
bashfully lowered eyelids casting a pathetic shade over the whole
countenance.

"'The doctor, in a tone bashfully low, asked my brother: ""Might I feel"
"her pulse?"""

"'I put out a tired, well-rounded wrist from beneath the coverlet."
"""Ah!"" thought I, as I looked on it, ""if only there had been a"
"sapphire bracelet.""[5] I have never before seen a doctor so awkward"
about feeling a patient's pulse. His fingers trembled as they felt
"my wrist. He measured the heat of my fever, I gauged the pulse of"
his heart.--Don't you believe me?'

"  [5] Widows are supposed to dress in white only, without ornaments or"
  jewellery.

"'Very easily,' said I; 'the human heart-beat tells its tale.'"

"'After I had been taken ill and restored to health several times,"
I found that the number of the courtiers who attended my imaginary
evening reception began to dwindle till they were reduced to only one!
And at last in my little world there remained only one doctor and one
patient.

'In these evenings I used to dress myself[6] secretly in a
canary-coloured  sari ; twine about the braided knot into which I did
my hair a garland of white jasmine blossoms; and with a little
mirror in my hand betake myself to my usual seat under the trees.

  [6] See note on p. 38.

'Well! Are you perhaps thinking that the sight of one's own beauty
would soon grow wearisome? Ah no! for I did not see myself with my own
eyes. I was then one and also two. I used to see myself as though I
"were the doctor; I gazed, I was charmed, I fell madly in love. But,"
"in spite of all the caresses I lavished on myself, a sigh would wander"
"about my heart, moaning like the evening breeze."

"'Anyhow, from that time I was never alone. When I walked I watched"
"with downcast eyes the play of my dainty little toes on the earth,"
and wondered what the doctor would have felt had he been there to
"see. At mid-day the sky would be filled with the glare of the sun,"
"without a sound, save now and then the distant cry of a passing kite."
Outside our garden-walls the hawker would pass with his musical
"cry of ""Bangles for sale, crystal bangles."" And I, spreading a"
"snow-white sheet on the lawn, would lie on it with my head on my arm."
With studied carelessness the other arm would rest lightly on the soft
"sheet, and I would imagine to myself that some one had caught sight of"
"the wonderful pose of my hand, that some one had clasped it in both of"
"his and imprinted a kiss on its rosy palm, and was slowly walking"
away.--What if I ended the story here? How would it do?'

"'Not half a bad ending,' I replied thoughtfully. 'It would no doubt"
"remain a little incomplete, but I could easily spend the rest of the"
night putting in the finishing touches.'

'But that would make the story too serious. Where would the laugh come
in? Where would be the skeleton with its grinning teeth?

"'So let me go on. As soon as the doctor had got a little practice, he"
took a room on the ground-floor of our house for a consulting-chamber.
I used then sometimes to ask him jokingly about medicines and
"poisons, and how much of this drug or that would kill a man. The"
subject was congenial and he would wax eloquent. These talks
familiarised me with the idea of death; and so love and death were
the only two things that filled my little world. My story is now
nearly ended--there is not much left.'

"'Not much of the night is left either,' I muttered."

'After a time I noticed that the doctor had grown strangely
"absent-minded, and it seemed as if he were ashamed of something"
"which he was trying to keep from me. One day he came in, somewhat"
"smartly dressed, and borrowed my brother's carriage for the evening."

"'My curiosity became too much for me, and I went up to my brother for"
"information. After some talk beside the point, I at last asked him:"
"""By the way, Dada,[7] where is the doctor going this evening in your"
"carriage?"""

  [7] Elder brother.

"'My brother briefly replied: ""To his death."""

"'""Oh, do tell me,"" I importuned. ""Where is he really going?"""

"'""To be married,"" he said, a little more explicitly."

"'""Oh, indeed!"" said I, as I laughed long and loudly."

"'I gradually learnt that the bride was an heiress, who would bring the"
doctor a large sum of money. But why did he insult me by hiding all
"this from me? Had I ever begged and prayed him not to marry, because it"
would break my heart? Men are not to be trusted. I have known only
"one man in all my life, and in a moment I made this discovery."

"'When the doctor came in after his work and was ready to start, I said"
"to him, rippling with laughter the while: ""Well, doctor, so you are"
"to be married to-night?"""

'My gaiety not only made the doctor lose countenance; it thoroughly
irritated him.

"'""How is it,"" I went on, ""that there is no illumination, no band of"
"music?"""

"'With a sigh he replied: ""Is marriage then such a joyful occasion?"""

"'I burst out into renewed laughter. ""No, no,"" said I, ""this will"
"never do. Who ever heard of a wedding without lights and music?"""

'I bothered my brother about it so much that he at once ordered all the
trappings of a gay wedding.

"'All the time I kept on gaily talking of the bride, of what would"
"happen, of what I would do when the bride came home. ""And, doctor,"" I"
"asked, ""will you still go on feeling pulses?"" Ha! ha! ha! Though"
"the inner workings of people's, especially men's, minds are not"
"visible, still I can take my oath that these words were piercing the"
doctor's bosom like deadly darts.

"'The marriage was to be celebrated late at night. Before starting,"
the doctor and my brother were having a glass of wine together on the
"terrace, as was their daily habit. The moon had just risen."

"'I went up smiling, and said: ""Have you forgotten your wedding,"
"doctor? It is time to start."""

'I must here tell you one little thing. I had meanwhile gone down
"to the dispensary and got a little powder, which at a convenient"
opportunity I had dropped unobserved into the doctor's glass.

"'The doctor, draining his glass at a gulp, in a voice thick with"
"emotion, and with a look that pierced me to the heart, said: ""Then I"
"must go."""

'The music struck up. I went into my room and dressed myself in my
bridal-robes of silk and gold. I took out my jewellery and ornaments
from the safe and put them all on; I put the red mark of wifehood
on the parting in my hair. And then under the tree in the garden I
prepared my bed.

'It was a beautiful night. The gentle south wind was kissing away
the weariness of the world. The scent of jasmine and  bela  filled the
garden with rejoicing.

'When the sound of the music began to grow fainter and fainter; the
light of the moon to get dimmer and dimmer; the world with its lifelong
associations of home and kin to fade away from my perceptions like
"some illusion;--then I closed my eyes, and smiled."

'I fancied that when people came and found me they would see that
"smile of mine lingering on my lips like a trace of rose-coloured wine,"
that when I thus slowly entered my eternal bridal-chamber I should
"carry with me this smile, illuminating my face. But alas for the"
bridal-chamber! Alas for the bridal-robes of silk and gold! When I
"woke at the sound of a rattling within me, I found three urchins"
learning osteology from my skeleton. Where in my bosom my joys and
"griefs used to throb, and the petals of youth to open one by one, there"
the master with his pointer was busy naming my bones. And as to that
"last smile, which I had so carefully rehearsed, did you see any sign of"
that?

"'Well, well, how did you like the story?'"

"'It has been delightful,' said I."

At this point the first crow began to caw. 'Are you there?' I asked.
There was no reply.

The morning light entered the room.




THE AUSPICIOUS VISION


Kantichandra was young; yet after his wife's death he sought no second
"partner, and gave his mind to the hunting of beasts and birds. His"
"body was long and slender, hard and agile; his sight keen; his aim"
"unerring. He dressed like a countryman, and took with him Hira Singh"
"the wrestler, Chakkanlal, Khan Saheb the musician, Mian Saheb, and"
many others. He had no lack of idle followers.

In the month of  Agrahayan  Kanti had gone out shooting near the swamp
"of Nydighi with a few sporting companions. They were in boats, and"
"an army of servants, in boats also, filled the bathing- ghats . The"
village women found it well-nigh impossible to bathe or to draw water.
"All day long, land and water trembled to the firing of the guns; and"
every evening musicians killed the chance of sleep.

"One morning as Kanti was seated in his boat cleaning a favourite gun,"
he suddenly started at what he thought was the cry of wild duck.
"Looking up, he saw a village maiden, coming to the water's edge, with"
two white ducklings clasped to her breast. The little stream was
almost stagnant. Many weeds choked the current. The girl put the birds
"into the water, and watched them anxiously. Evidently the presence of"
the sportsmen was the cause of her care and not the wildness of the
ducks.

The girl's beauty had a rare freshness--as if she had just come
from Vishwakarma's[8] workshop. It was difficult to guess her age.
"Her figure was almost a woman's, but her face was so childish that"
clearly the world had left no impression there. She seemed not to
know herself that she had reached the threshold of youth.

  [8] The divine craftsman in Hindu mythology.

Kanti's gun-cleaning stopped for a while. He was fascinated. He had
not expected to see such a face in such a spot. And yet its beauty
suited its surroundings better than it would have suited a palace. A
bud is lovelier on the bough than in a golden vase. That day the
"blossoming reeds glittered in the autumn dew and morning sun, and"
"the fresh, simple face set in the midst was like a picture of festival"
to Kanti's enchanted mind. Kalidos has forgotten to sing how Siva's
"Mountain-Queen herself sometimes has come to the young Ganges, with"
"just such ducklings in her breast. As he gazed, the maiden started"
"in terror, and hurriedly took back the ducks into her bosom with a"
"half-articulate cry of pain. In another moment, she had left the"
river-bank and disappeared into the bamboo thicket hard by. Looking
"round, Kanti saw one of his men pointing an unloaded gun at the ducks."
"He at once went up to him, wrenched away his gun, and bestowed on his"
cheek a prodigious slap. The astonished humourist finished his joke
on the floor. Kanti went on cleaning his gun.

But curiosity drove Kanti to the thicket wherein he had seen the girl
"disappear. Pushing his way through, he found himself in the yard"
of a well-to-do householder. On one side was a row of conical thatched
"barns, on the other a clean cow-shed, at the end of which grew a"
 zizyph  bush. Under the bush was seated the girl he had seen that
"morning, sobbing over a wounded dove, into whose yellow beak she was"
trying to wring a little water from the moist corner of her garment.
"A grey cat, its fore-paws on her knee, was looking eagerly at the"
"bird, and every now and then, when it got too forward, she kept it in"
its place by a warning tap on the nose.

"This little picture, set in the peaceful mid-day surroundings of the"
"householder's yard, instantly impressed itself on Kanti's sensitive"
"heart. The checkered light and shade, flickering beneath the delicate"
"foliage of the  zizyph , played on the girl's lap. Not far off a"
"cow was chewing the cud, and lazily keeping off the flies with slow"
movements of its head and tail. The north wind whispered softly in
the rustling bamboo thickets. And she who at dawn on the river-bank had
"looked like the Forest Queen, now in the silence of noon showed the"
"eager pity of the Divine Housewife. Kanti, coming in upon her with"
"his gun, had a sense of intrusion. He felt like a thief caught"
red-handed. He longed to explain that it was not he who had hurt
"the dove. As he wondered how he should begin, there came a call of"
'Sudha!' from the house. The girl jumped up. 'Sudha!' came the
"voice again. She took up her dove, and ran within. 'Sudha,'[9]"
"thought Kanti, 'what an appropriate name!'"

"  [9]  Sudha  means nectar, ambrosia."

"Kanti returned to the boat, handed his gun to his men, and went over to"
"the front door of the house. He found a middle-aged Brahmin, with a"
"peaceful, clean-shaven face, seated on a bench outside, and reading"
"a devotional book. Kanti saw in his kindly, thoughtful face something"
of the tenderness which shone in the face of the maiden.

"Kanti saluted him, and said: 'May I ask for some water, sir? I am"
"very thirsty.' The elder man welcomed him with eager hospitality, and,"
"offering him a seat on the bench, went inside and fetched with his own"
hands a little brass plate of sugar wafers and a bell-metal vessel
full of water.

"After Kanti had eaten and drunk, the Brahmin begged him to introduce"
"himself. Kanti gave his own name, his father's name, and the address of"
"his home, and then said in the usual way: 'If I can be of any service,"
"sir, I shall deem myself fortunate.'"

"'I require no service, my son,' said Nabin Banerji; 'I have only"
one care at present.'

"'What is that, sir?' said Kanti."

"'It is my daughter, Sudha, who is growing up' (Kanti smiled as he"
"thought of her babyish face), 'and for whom I have not yet been able"
"to find a worthy bridegroom. If I could only see her well married,"
all my debt to this world would be paid. But there is no suitable
"bridegroom here, and I cannot leave my charge of Gopinath here, to"
search for a husband elsewhere.'

"'If you would see me in my boat, sir, we would have a talk about the"
"marriage of your daughter.' So saying, Kanti repeated his salute and"
"went back. He then sent some of his men into the village to inquire,"
and in answer heard nothing but praise of the beauty and virtues of
the Brahmin's daughter.

"When next day the old man came to the boat on his promised visit,"
"Kanti bent low in salutation, and begged the hand of his daughter for"
himself. The Brahmin was so much overcome by this undreamed-of piece
of good fortune--for Kanti not only belonged to a well-known Brahmin
"family, but was also a landed proprietor of wealth and position--that"
at first he could hardly utter a word in reply. He thought there must
"have been some mistake, and at length mechanically repeated: 'You"
desire to marry my daughter?'

"'If you will deign to give her to me,' said Kanti."

'You mean Sudha?' he asked again.

"'Yes,' was the reply."

'But will you not first see and speak to her----?'

"Kanti, pretending he had not seen her already, said: 'Oh, that we"
shall do at the moment of the Auspicious Vision.'[10]

  [10] After betrothal the prospective bride and bridegroom are not
  supposed to see each other again till that part of the wedding
  ceremony which is called  the Auspicious Vision .

In a voice husky with emotion the old man said: 'My Sudha is indeed
"a good girl, well skilled in all the household arts. As you are so"
"generously taking her on trust, may she never cause you a moment's"
regret. This is my blessing!'

The brick-built mansion of the Mazumdars had been borrowed for the
"wedding ceremony, which was fixed for next  Magh , as Kanti did not"
"wish to delay. In due time the bridegroom arrived on his elephant, with"
"drums and music and with a torchlight procession, and the ceremony"
began.

When the bridal couple were covered with the scarlet screen for the
"rite of the Auspicious Vision, Kanti looked up at his bride. In that"
"bashful, downcast face, crowned with the wedding coronet and bedecked"
"with sandal paste, he could scarcely recognise the village maiden of"
"his fancy, and in the fulness of his emotion a mist seemed to becloud"
his eyes.

"At the gathering of women in the bridal chamber, after the wedding"
"ceremony was over, an old village dame insisted that Kanti himself"
should take off his wife's bridal veil. As he did so he started back.
It was not the same girl.

Something rose from within his breast and pierced into his brain. The
"light of the lamps seemed to grow dim, and darkness to tarnish the face"
of the bride herself.

At first he felt angry with his father-in-law. The old scoundrel
"had shown him one girl, and married him to another. But on calmer"
reflection he remembered that the old man had not shown him any
daughter at all--that it was all his own fault. He thought it best
"not to show his arrant folly to the world, and took his place again"
with apparent calmness.

He could swallow the powder; he could not get rid of its taste. He
could not bear the merry-makings of the festive throng. He was in a
blaze of anger with himself as well as with everybody else.

"Suddenly he felt the bride, seated by his side, give a little start"
"and a suppressed scream; a leveret, scampering into the room, had"
brushed across her feet. Close upon it followed the girl he had seen
"before. She caught up the leveret into her arms, and began to caress"
"it with an affectionate murmuring. 'Oh, the mad girl!' cried the"
women as they made signs to her to leave the room. She heeded them
"not, however, but came and unconcernedly sat in front of the wedded"
"pair, looking into their faces with a childish curiosity. When a"
"maidservant came and took her by the arm to lead her away, Kanti"
"hurriedly interposed, saying, 'Let her be.'"

'What is your name?' he then went on to ask her.

The girl swayed backwards and forwards but gave no reply. All the women
in the room began to titter.

Kanti put another question: 'Have those ducklings of yours grown up?'

The girl stared at him as unconcernedly as before.

"The bewildered Kanti screwed up courage for another effort, and asked"
"tenderly after the wounded dove, but with no avail. The increasing"
laughter in the room betokened an amusing joke.

"At last Kanti learned that the girl was deaf and dumb, the companion of"
all the animals and birds of the locality. It was but by chance that
she rose the other day when the name of Sudha was called.

Kanti now received a second shock. A black screen lifted from before
"his eyes. With a sigh of intense relief, as of escape from calamity,"
he looked once more into the face of his bride. Then came the true
Auspicious Vision. The light from his heart and from the smokeless
"lamps fell on her gracious face; and he saw it in its true radiance,"
knowing that Nabin's blessing would find fulfilment.




THE SUPREME NIGHT


I used to go to the same dame's school with Surabala and play at
"marriage with her. When I paid visits to her house, her mother would"
"pet me, and setting us side by side would say to herself: 'What a"
lovely pair!'

"I was a child then, but I could understand her meaning well enough. The"
idea became rooted in my mind that I had a special right to Surabala
"above that of people in general. So it happened that, in the pride of"
"ownership, at times I punished and tormented her; and she, too, fagged"
for me and bore all my punishments without complaint. The village was
wont to praise her beauty; but in the eyes of a young barbarian like
me that beauty had no glory;--I knew only that Surabala had been
"born in her father's house solely to bear my yoke, and that therefore"
she was the particular object of my neglect.

"My father was the land-steward of the Chaudhuris, a family of"
" zemindars . It was his plan, as soon as I had learnt to write a good"
"hand, to train me in the work of estate management and secure a rent"
collectorship for me somewhere. But in my heart I disliked the
"proposal. Nilratan of our village had run away to Calcutta, had"
"learnt English there, and finally became the  Nazir [11] of the"
District Magistrate;  that  was my life's ideal: I was secretly
"determined to be the Head Clerk of the Judge's Court, even if I could"
not become the Magistrate's  Nazir .

  [11] Superintendent of bailiffs.

I saw that my father always treated these court officers with the
greatest respect. I knew from my childhood that they had to be
"propitiated with gifts of fish, vegetables, and even money. For this"
reason I had given a seat of high honour in my heart to the court
"underlings, even to the bailiffs. These are the gods worshipped in our"
"Bengal,--a modern miniature edition of the 330 millions of deities"
"of the Hindu pantheon. For gaining material success, people have"
"more genuine faith in  them  than in the good Ganesh, the giver of"
success; hence the people now offer to these officers everything
that was formerly Ganesh's due.

"Fired by the example of Nilratan, I too seized a suitable opportunity"
and ran away to Calcutta. There I first put up in the house of a
"village acquaintance, and afterwards got some funds from my father for"
my education. Thus I carried on my studies regularly.

"In addition, I joined political and benevolent societies. I had no"
doubt whatever that it was urgently necessary for me to give my life
suddenly for my country. But I knew not how such a hard task could be
carried out. Also no one showed me the way.

"But, nevertheless, my enthusiasm did not abate at all. We country lads"
had not learnt to sneer at everything like the precocious boys of
"Calcutta, and hence our faith was very strong. The 'leaders' of our"
"associations delivered speeches, and we went begging for subscriptions"
from door to door in the hot blaze of noon without breaking our fast;
"or we stood by the roadside distributing hand-bills, or arranged the"
"chairs and benches in the lecture-hall, and, if anybody whispered"
"a word against our leader, we got ready to fight him. For these things"
the city boys used to laugh at us as provincials.

"I had come to Calcutta to be a  Nazir  or a Head Clerk, but I was"
preparing to become a Mazzini or a Garibaldi.

At this time Surabala's father and my father laid their heads together
to unite us in marriage. I had come to Calcutta at the age of fifteen;
"Surabala was eight years old then. I was now eighteen, and in my"
father's opinion I was almost past the age of marriage. But it was
my secret vow to remain unmarried all my life and to die for my
country; so I told my father that I would not marry before I had
finished my education.

In two or three months I learnt that Surabala had been married to a
pleader named Ram Lochan. I was then busy collecting subscriptions for
"raising fallen India, and this news did not seem worth my thought."

"I had matriculated, and was about to appear at the Intermediate"
"Examination, when my father died. I was not alone in the world, but"
had to maintain my mother and two sisters. I had therefore to leave
college and look out for employment. After a good deal of exertion
I secured the post of second master in the matriculation school of a
small town in the Noakhali District.

"I thought, here is just the work for me! By my advice and inspiration I"
shall train up every one of my pupils as a general for future India.

"I began to work, and then found that the impending examination was a"
more pressing affair than the future of India. The headmaster got angry
whenever I talked of anything outside grammar or algebra. And in a few
"months my enthusiasm, too, flagged."

I am no genius. In the quiet of the home I may form vast plans; but
"when I enter the field of work, I have to bear the yoke of the plough"
"on my neck like the Indian bullock, get my tail twisted by my master,"
"break clods all day, patiently and with bowed head, and then at sunset"
have to be satisfied if I can get any cud to chew. Such a creature
has not the spirit to prance and caper.

"One of the teachers lived in the school-house, to guard against fires."
"As I was a bachelor, this work was thrown on me. I lodged in a thatched"
shed close to the large cottage in which the school sat.

The school-house stood at some distance from the inhabited portion of
"the town, and beside a big tank. Around it were betel-nut, cocoa-nut,"
"and  madar  trees, and very near to the school building two large"
"ancient  nim  trees grew close together, and cast a cool shade around."

"One thing I have forgotten to mention, and indeed I had not so long"
"considered it worth mentioning. The local Government pleader, Ram"
"Lochan Ray, lived near our school. I also knew that his wife--my early"
"playmate, Surabala--lived with him."

I got acquainted with Ram Lochan Babu. I cannot say whether he knew
that I had known Surabala in childhood. I did not think fit to mention
"the fact at my first introduction to him. Indeed, I did not clearly"
remember that Surabala had been ever linked with my life in any way.

One holiday I paid a visit to Ram Lochan Babu. The subject of our
conversation has gone out of my mind; probably it was the unhappy
condition of present-day India. Not that he was very much concerned
or heart-broken over the matter; but the subject was such that one
could freely pour forth one's sentimental sorrow over it for an hour
or two while puffing at one's  hooka .

"While thus engaged, I heard in a side-room the softest possible jingle"
"of bracelets, crackle of dress, and footfall; and I felt certain that"
two curious eyes were watching me through a small opening of the window.

"All at once there flashed upon my memory a pair of eyes,--a pair of"
"large eyes, beaming with trust, simplicity, and girlhood's love,--black"
"pupils,--thick dark eyelashes,--a calm fixed gaze. Suddenly some"
"unseen force squeezed my heart in an iron grip, and it throbbed with"
intense pain.

"I returned to my house, but the pain clung to me. Whether I read,"
"wrote, or did any other work, I could not shake that weight off my"
heart; a heavy load seemed to be always swinging from my heart-strings.

"In the evening, calming myself a little, I began to reflect: 'What"
ails me?' From within came the question: 'Where is  your  Surabala
now?' I replied: 'I gave her up of my free will. Surely I did not
expect her to wait for me for ever.'

But something kept saying: ' Then  you could have got her merely for
"the asking.  Now  you have not the right to look at her even once,"
do what you will. That Surabala of your boyhood may come very close to
you; you may hear the jingle of her bracelets; you may breathe the air
"embalmed by the essence of her hair,--but there will always be a wall"
between you two.'

I answered: 'Be it so. What is Surabala to me?'

My heart rejoined: 'To-day Surabala is nobody to you. But what might
she not have been to you?'

Ah! that's true.  What  might she not have been to me? Dearest to me
"of all things, closer to me than the world besides, the sharer of all"
"my life's joys and sorrows,--she might have been. And now, she is so"
"distant, so much of a stranger, that to look on her is forbidden,"
"to talk with her is improper, and to think of her is a sin!--while"
"this Ram Lochan, coming suddenly from nowhere, has muttered a few set"
"religious texts, and in one swoop has carried off Surabala from the"
rest of mankind!

"I have not come to preach a new ethical code, or to revolutionise"
society; I have no wish to tear asunder domestic ties. I am only
"expressing the exact working of my mind, though it may not be"
reasonable. I could not by any means banish from my mind the sense
"that Surabala, reigning there within shelter of Ram Lochan's home,"
"was mine far more than his. The thought was, I admit, unreasonable"
"and improper,--but it was not unnatural."

Thereafter I could not set my mind to any kind of work. At noon when
"the boys in my class hummed, when Nature outside simmered in the sun,"
when the sweet scent of the  nim  blossoms entered the room on the
"tepid breeze, I then wished,--I know not what I wished for; but this"
"I can say, that I did not wish to pass all my life in correcting the"
grammar exercises of those future hopes of India.

"When school was over, I could not bear to live in my large lonely"
"house; and yet, if any one paid me a visit, it bored me. In the"
gloaming as I sat by the tank and listened to the meaningless breeze
"sighing through the betel- and cocoa-nut palms, I used to muse that"
human society is a web of mistakes; nobody has the sense to do the
"right thing at the right time, and when the chance is gone we break"
our hearts over vain longings.

I could have married Surabala and lived happily. But I must be a
"Garibaldi,--and I ended by becoming the second master of a village"
"school! And pleader Ram Lochan Ray, who had no special call to be"
"Surabala's husband,--to whom, before his marriage, Surabala was no"
"wise different from a hundred other maidens,--has very quietly married"
"her, and is earning lots of money as Government pleader; when his"
"dinner is badly cooked he scolds Surabala, and when he is in good"
"humour he gives her a bangle! He is sleek and fat, tidily dressed,"
free from every kind of worry;  he  never passes his evenings by the
tank gazing at the stars and sighing.

Ram Lochan was called away from our town for a few days by a big case
elsewhere. Surabala in her house was as lonely as I was in my school
building.

I remember it was a Monday. The sky was overcast with clouds from the
morning. It began to drizzle at ten o'clock. At the aspect of the
heavens our headmaster closed the school early. All day the black
detached clouds began to run about in the sky as if making ready for
"some grand display. Next day, towards afternoon, the rain descended"
"in torrents, accompanied by storm. As the night advanced the fury of"
wind and water increased. At first the wind was easterly; gradually
"it veered, and blew towards the south and south-west."

It was idle to try to sleep on such a night. I remembered that in this
terrible weather Surabala was alone in her house. Our school was much
more strongly built than her bungalow. Often and often did I plan to
"invite her to the school-house, while I meant to pass the night alone"
by the tank. But I could not summon up courage for it.

"When it was half-past one in the morning, the roar of the tidal wave"
"was suddenly heard,--the sea was rushing on us! I left my room and ran"
"towards Surabala's house. In the way stood one embankment of our tank,"
and as I was wading to it the flood already reached my knees. When I
"mounted the bank, a second wave broke on it. The highest part of the"
bank was more than seventeen feet above the plain.

"As I climbed up the bank, another person reached it from the opposite"
"side. Who she was, every fibre of my body knew at once, and my whole"
"soul was thrilled with the consciousness. I had no doubt that she, too,"
had recognised me.

On an island some three yards in area stood we two; all else was
covered with water.

It was a time of cataclysm; the stars had been blotted out of the
sky; all the lights of the earth had been darkened; there would have
been no harm if we had held converse  then . But we could not bring
ourselves to utter a word; neither of us made even a formal inquiry
after the other's health. Only we stood gazing at the darkness. At our
"feet swirled the dense, black, wild, roaring torrent of death."

"To-day Surabala has come to  my  side, leaving the whole world. To-day"
she has none besides  me . In our far-off childhood this Surabala
"had come from some dark primeval realm of mystery, from a life in"
"another orb, and stood by my side on this luminous peopled earth; and"
"to-day, after a wide span of time, she has left that earth, so full"
"of light and human beings, to stand alone by  my  side amidst this"
terrible desolate gloom of Nature's death-convulsion. The stream of
"birth had flung that tender bud before me, and the flood of death had"
"wafted the same flower, now in full bloom, to  me  and to none else."
One more wave and we shall be swept away from this extreme point of the
"earth, torn from the stalks on which we now sit apart, and made one"
in death.

"May that wave never come! May Surabala live long and happily, girt"
"round by husband and children, household and kinsfolk! This one night,"
"standing on the brink of Nature's destruction, I have tasted eternal"
bliss.

"The night wore out, the tempest ceased, the flood abated; without a"
"word spoken, Surabala went back to her house, and I, too, returned to"
my shed without having uttered a word.

"I reflected: True, I have become no  Nazir  or Head Clerk, nor a"
Garibaldi; I am only the second master of a beggarly school. But one
night had for its brief space beamed upon my whole life's course.

"That one night, out of all the days and nights of my allotted span,"
has been the supreme glory of my humble existence.




RAJA AND RANI


Bipin Kisore was born 'with a golden spoon in his mouth'; hence he
knew how to squander money twice as well as how to earn it. The natural
result was that he could not live long in the house where he was born.

"He was a delicate young man of comely appearance, an adept in music, a"
"fool in business, and unfit for life's handicap. He rolled along life's"
road like the wheel of Jagannath's car. He could not long command
his wonted style of magnificent living.

"Luckily, however, Raja Chittaranjan, having got back his property"
"from the Court of Wards, was intent upon organising an Amateur Theatre"
Party. Captivated by the prepossessing looks of Bipin Kisore and his
"musical endowments, the Raja gladly 'admitted him of his crew.'"

Chittaranjan was a B.A. He was not given to any excesses. Though the
"son of a rich man, he used to dine and sleep at appointed hours"
and even at appointed places. And he suddenly became enamoured of
Bipin like one unto drink. Often did meals cool and nights grow old
while he listened to Bipin and discussed with him the merits of
operatic compositions. The Dewan remarked that the only blemish in
the otherwise perfect character of his master was his inordinate
fondness for Bipin Kisore.

"Rani Basanta Kumari raved at her husband, and said that he was wasting"
"himself on a luckless baboon. The sooner she could do away with him,"
the easier she would feel.

The Raja was much pleased in his heart at this seeming jealousy of
"his youthful wife. He smiled, and thought that women-folk know only one"
man upon the earth--him whom they love; and never think of other
"men's deserts. That there may be many whose merits deserve regard,"
is not recorded in the scriptures of women. The only good man and
the only object of a woman's favours is he who has blabbered into her
ears the matrimonial incantations. A little moment behind the usual
"hour of her husband's meals is a world of anxiety to her, but she"
never cares a brass button if her husband's dependents have a mouthful
or not. This inconsiderate partiality of the softer sex might be
"cavilled at, but to Chittaranjan it did not seem unpleasant. Thus, he"
would often indulge in hyperbolic laudations of Bipin in his wife's
"presence, just to provoke a display of her delightful fulminations."

"But what was sport to the 'royal' couple, was death to poor Bipin."
"The servants of the house, as is their wont, took their cue from the"
"Rani's apathetic and wilful neglect of the wretched hanger-on, and"
grew more apathetic and wilful still. They contrived to forget to look
"after his comforts, to Bipin's infinite chagrin and untold sufferings."

"Once the Rani rebuked the servant Put, and said: 'You are always"
"shirking work; what do you do all through the day?' 'Pray, madam,"
the whole day is taken up in serving Bipin Babu under the Maharaja's
"orders,' stammered the poor valet."

"The Rani retorted: 'Your Bipin Babu is a great Nawab, eh?' This was"
enough for Put. He took the hint. From the very next day he left
"Bipin Babu's orts as they were, and at times forgot to cover the food"
for him. With unpractised hands Bipin often scoured his own dishes
and not unfrequently went without meals. But it was not in him to whine
and report to the Raja. It was not in him to lower himself by petty
squabblings with menials. He did not mind it; he took everything in
"good part. And thus while the Raja's favours grew, the Rani's disfavour"
"intensified, and at last knew no bounds."

Now the opera of  Subhadraharan  was ready after due rehearsal. The
stage was fitted up in the palace court-yard. The Raja acted the part
"of 'Krishna,' and Bipin that of 'Arjuna.' Oh, how sweetly he sang!"
how beautiful he looked! The audience applauded in transports of joy.

"The play over, the Raja came to the Rani and asked her how she liked"
"it. The Rani replied: 'Indeed, Bipin acted the part of ""Arjuna"""
gloriously! He does look like the scion of a noble family. His voice is
rare!' The Raja said jocosely: 'And how do I look? Am I not fair?
"Have I not a sweet voice?' 'Oh, yours is different case!' added"
"the Rani, and again fell to dilating on the histrionic abilities of"
Bipin Kisore.

"The tables were now turned. He who used to praise, now began to"
"deprecate. The Raja, who was never weary of indulging in high-sounding"
"panegyrics of Bipin before his consort, now suddenly fell reflecting"
"that, after all, unthinking people made too much of Bipin's actual"
merits. What was extraordinary about his appearance or voice? A
"short while before he himself was one of those unthinking men, but in"
a sudden and mysterious way he developed symptoms of thoughtfulness!

"From the day following, every good arrangement was made for Bipin's"
meals. The Rani told the Raja: 'It is undoubtedly wrong to lodge Bipin
Babu with the petty officers of the Raj in the Kachari[12]; for all he
"now is, he was once a man of means.' The Raja ejaculated curtly:"
'Ha!' and turned the subject. The Rani proposed that there might
be another performance on the occasion of the first-rice ceremony
of the 'royal' weanling. The Raja heard and heard her not.

"  [12]  Kachari , generally anglicised as  cuteberry : offices and"
  courts.

Once on being reprimanded by the Raja for not properly laying his
"cloth, the servant Put replied: 'What can I do? According to the"
Rani's behests I have to look after Bipin Babu and wait on him the
"livelong day.' This angered the Raja, and he exclaimed, highly"
"nettled: 'Pshaw! Bipin Babu is a veritable Nawab, I see! Can't he"
"cleanse his own dishes himself?' The servant, as before, took his"
"cue, and Bipin lapsed back into his former wretchedness."

The Rani liked Bipin's songs--they were sweet--there was no gainsaying
it. When her husband sat with Bipin to the wonted discourses of sweet
"music of an evening, she would listen from behind the screen in an"
"adjoining room. Not long afterwards, the Raja began again his old habit"
of dining and sleeping at regular hours. The music came to an end.
Bipin's evening services were no more needed.

Raja Chittaranjan used to look after his  zemindari  affairs at noon.
"One day he came earlier to the zenana, and found his consort reading"
"something. On his asking her what she read, the Rani was a little"
"taken aback, but promptly replied: 'I am conning over a few songs"
from Bipin Babu's song-book. We have not had any music since you
tired abruptly of your musical hobby.' Poor woman! it was she who
had herself made no end of efforts to eradicate the hobby from her
husband's mind.

On the morrow the Raja dismissed Bipin--without a thought as to how
and where the poor fellow would get a morsel henceforth!

Nor was this the only matter of regret to Bipin. He had been bound to
the Raja by the dearest and most sincere tie of attachment. He served
him more for affection than for pay. He was fonder of his friend than
"of the wages he received. Even after deep cogitation, Bipin could not"
ascertain the cause of the Raja's sudden estrangement. ''Tis Fate! all
"is Fate!' Bipin said to himself. And then, silently and bravely,"
"he heaved a deep sigh, picked up his old guitar, put it up in the"
"case, paid the last two coins in his pocket as a farewell  bakshish "
"to Put, and walked out into the wide wide world where he had not a"
soul to call his friend.




THE TRUST PROPERTY


I

Brindaban Kundu came to his father in a rage and said: 'I am off this
moment.'

"'Ungrateful wretch!' sneered the father, Jaganath Kundu. 'When you"
"have paid me back all that I have spent on your food and clothing, it"
will be time enough to give yourself these airs.'

Such food and clothing as was customary in Jaganath's household could
not have cost very much. Our  rishis  of old managed to feed and
clothe themselves on an incredibly small outlay. Jaganath's behaviour
showed that his ideal in these respects was equally high. That he
could not fully live up to it was due partly to the bad influence of
"the degenerate society around him, and partly to certain unreasonable"
demands of Nature in her attempt to keep body and soul together.

"So long as Brindaban was single, things went smoothly enough, but"
after his marriage he began to depart from the high and rarefied
standard cherished by his sire. It was clear that the son's ideas
"of comfort were moving away from the spiritual to the material, and"
imitating the ways of the world. He was unwilling to put up with the
"discomforts of heat and cold, thirst and hunger. His minimum of food"
and clothing rose apace.

Frequent were the quarrels between the father and the son. At last
Brindaban's wife became seriously ill and a  kabiraj [13] was called
"in. But when the doctor prescribed a costly medicine for his patient,"
"Jaganath took it as a proof of sheer incompetence, and turned him"
out immediately. At first Brindaban besought his father to allow the
"treatment to continue; then he quarrelled with him about it, but to"
"no purpose. When his wife died, he abused his father and called him"
a murderer.

"  [13] Country doctor, unqualified by any medical training."

'Nonsense!' said the father. 'Don't people die even after swallowing
"all kinds of drugs? If costly medicines could save life, how is it"
that kings and emperors are not immortal? You don't expect your wife
to die with more pomp and ceremony than did your mother and your
"grandmother before her, do you?'"

Brindaban might really have derived a great consolation from these
"words, had he not been overwhelmed with grief and incapable of"
proper thinking. Neither his mother nor his grandmother had taken any
"medicine before making their exit from this world, and this was the"
"time-honoured custom of the family. But, alas, the younger generation"
was unwilling to die according to ancient custom. The English had
newly come to the country at the time we speak of. Even in those remote
"days, the good old folks were horrified at the unorthodox ways of the"
"new generation, and sat speechless, trying to draw comfort from"
their  hookas .

"Be that as it may, the modern Brindaban said to his old fogy of a"
father: 'I am off.'

"The father instantly agreed, and wished publicly that, should he ever"
"give his son one single pice in future, the gods might reckon his act"
as shedding the holy blood of cows. Brindaban in his turn similarly
"wished that, should he ever accept anything from his father, his act"
might be held as bad as matricide.

The people of the village looked upon this small revolution as a
great relief after a long period of monotony. And when Jaganath
"disinherited his only son, every one did his best to console him."
All were unanimous in the opinion that to quarrel with a father for
the sake of a wife was possible only in these degenerate days. And
"the reason they gave was sound too. 'When your wife dies,' they"
"said, 'you can find a second one without delay. But when your father"
"dies, you can't get another to replace him for love or money.'"
"Their logic no doubt was perfect, but we suspect that the utter"
hopelessness of getting another father did not trouble the misguided
"son very much. On the contrary, he looked upon it as a mercy."

Nor did separation from Brindaban weigh heavily on the mind of his
"father. In the first place, his absence from home reduced the household"
"expenses. Then, again, the father was freed from a great anxiety. The"
fear of being poisoned by his son and heir had always haunted him. When
"he ate his scanty fare, he could never banish the thought of poison"
from his mind. This fear had abated somewhat after the death of his
"daughter-in-law, and, now that the son was gone, it disappeared"
altogether.

But there was one tender spot in the old man's heart. Brindaban had
"taken away with him his four-year-old son, Gokul Chandra. Now, the"
"expense of keeping the child was comparatively small, and so Jaganath's"
"affection for him was without a drawback. Still, when Brindaban took"
"him away, his grief, sincere as it was, was mingled at first with"
calculation as to how much he would save a month by the absence of the
"two, how much the sum would come to in the year, and what would be the"
capital to bring it in as interest.

"But the empty house, without Gokul Chandra in it to make mischief,"
became more and more difficult for the old man to live in. There
was no one now to play tricks upon him when he was engaged in his
" puja ,[14] no one to snatch away his food and eat it, no one to"
"run away with his inkpot, when he was writing up his accounts. His"
"daily routine of life, now uninterrupted, became an intolerable burden"
to him. He bethought him that this unworried peace was endurable
only in the world to come. When he caught sight of the holes made in
"his quilt by his grandchild, and the pen-and-ink sketches executed by"
"the same artist on his rush-mat, his heart was heavy with grief."
Once upon a time he had reproached the boy bitterly because he had torn
his  dhoti  into pieces within the short space of two years; now
tears stood in Jaganath's eyes as he gazed upon the dirty remnants
"lying in the bedroom. He carefully put them away in his safe, and"
"registered a vow that, should Gokul ever come back again, he should"
not be reprimanded even if he destroyed one  dhoti  a year.

  [14] A ceremonial worship.

"But Gokul did not return, and poor Jaganath aged rapidly. His empty"
home seemed emptier every day.

No longer could the old man stay peacefully at home. Even in the
"middle of the day, when all respectable folks in the village enjoyed"
"their after-dinner siesta, Jaganath might be seen roaming over the"
"village,  hooka  in hand. The boys, at sight of him, would give up"
"their play, and, retiring in a body to a safe distance, chant verses"
"composed by a local poet, praising the old gentleman's economical"
"habits. No one ventured to say his real name, lest he should have to go"
without his meal that day[15]--and so people gave him names after their
"own fancy. Elderly people called him Jaganash,[16] but the reason why"
the younger generation preferred to call him a vampire was hard to
"guess. It may be that the bloodless, dried-up skin of the old man"
had some physical resemblance to the vampire's.

  [15] It is a superstition current in Bengal that if a man pronounces
"  the name of a very miserly individual, he has to go without his meal"
  that day.

"  [16] Jaganath is the Lord of Festivity, and Jaga nash  would mean the"
  despoiler of it.


II

"One afternoon, when Jaganath was rambling as usual through the village"
"lanes shaded by mango topes, he saw a boy, apparently a stranger,"
assuming the captaincy of the village boys and explaining to them
the scheme of some new prank. Won by the force of his character and
"the startling novelty of his ideas, the boys had all sworn allegiance"
"to him. Unlike the others, he did not run away from the old man as"
"he approached, but came quite close to him and began to shake his own"
 chadar . The result was that a live lizard sprang out of it on to
"the old man's body, ran down his back and off towards the jungle."
"Sudden fright made the poor man shiver from head to foot, to the"
"great amusement of the other boys, who shouted with glee. Before"
"Jaganath had gone far, cursing and swearing, the  gamcha  on his"
"shoulder suddenly disappeared, and the next moment it was seen on"
"the head of the new boy, transformed into a turban."

The novel attentions of this manikin came as a great relief to
Jaganath. It was long since any boy had taken such freedom with him.
"After a good deal of coaxing and many fair promises, he at last"
"persuaded the boy to come to him, and this was the conversation"
which followed:

"'What's your name, my boy?'"

'Nitai Pal.'

'Where's your home?'

'Won't tell.'

'Who's your father?'

'Won't tell.'

'Why won't you?'

'Because I have run away from home.'

'What made you do it?'

'My father wanted to send me to school.'

It occurred to Jaganath that it would be useless extravagance to send
"such a boy to school, and his father must have been an unpractical fool"
not to have thought so.

"'Well, well,' said Jaganath, 'how would you like to come and stay"
with me?'

"'Don't mind,' said the boy, and forthwith he installed himself in"
Jaganath's house. He felt as little hesitation as though it were
the shadow of a tree by the wayside. And not only that. He began
to proclaim his wishes as regards his food and clothing with such
coolness that you would have thought he had paid his reckoning in full
"beforehand; and, when anything went wrong, he did not scruple to"
quarrel with the old man. It had been easy enough for Jaganath to get
"the better of his own child; but, now, where another man's child was"
"concerned, he had to acknowledge defeat."


III

The people of the village marvelled when Nitai Pal was unexpectedly
made so much of by Jaganath. They felt sure that the old man's end
"was near, and the prospect of his bequeathing all his property to this"
"unknown brat made their hearts sore. Furious with envy, they determined"
"to do the boy an injury, but the old man took care of him as though"
he was a rib in his breast.

"At times, the boy threatened that he would go away, and the old man"
used to say to him temptingly: 'I will leave you all the property I
"possess.' Young as he was, the boy fully understood the grandeur of"
this promise.

The village people then began to make inquiries after the father of the
"boy. Their hearts melted with compassion for the agonised parents,"
and they declared that the son must be a rascal to cause them so much
"suffering. They heaped abuses on his head, but the heat with which"
they did it betrayed envy rather than a sense of justice.

One day the old man learned from a wayfarer that one Damodar Pal was
"seeking his lost son, and was even now coming towards the village."
"Nitai, when he heard this, became very restless and was ready to run"
"away, leaving his future wealth to take care of itself. Jaganath"
"reassured him, saying: 'I mean to hide you where nobody can find"
you--not even the village people themselves.'

"This whetted the curiosity of the boy and he said: 'Oh, where? Do show"
me.'

"'People will know, if I show you now. Wait till it is night,' said"
Jaganath.

The hope of discovering the mysterious hiding-place delighted Nitai. He
"planned to himself how, as soon as his father had gone away without"
"him, he would have a bet with his comrades, and play hide-and-seek."
"Nobody would be able to find him. Wouldn't it be fun? His father, too,"
"would ransack the whole village, and not find him--that would be rare"
fun also.

"At noon, Jaganath shut the boy up in his house, and disappeared for"
"some time. When he came home again, Nitai worried him with questions."

"No sooner was it dark than Nitai said: 'Grandfather, shall we go now?'"

"'It isn't night yet,' replied Jaganath."

"A little while later the boy exclaimed: 'It is night now, grandfather;"
come let's go.'

"'The village people haven't gone to bed yet,' whispered Jaganath."

"Nitai waited but a moment, and said: 'They have gone to bed now,"
grandfather; I am sure they have. Let's start now.'

The night advanced. Sleep began to weigh heavily on the eyelids of
"the poor boy, and it was a hard struggle for him to keep awake. At"
"midnight, Jaganath caught hold of the boy's arm, and left the house,"
groping through the dark lanes of the sleeping village. Not a sound
"disturbed the stillness, except the occasional howl of a dog, when"
"all the other dogs far and near would join in chorus, or perhaps the"
"flapping of a night-bird, scared by the sound of human footsteps at"
"that unusual hour. Nitai trembled with fear, and held Jaganath fast"
by the arm.

"Across many a field they went, and at last came to a jungle, where"
"stood a dilapidated temple without a god in it. 'What, here!'"
exclaimed Nitai in a tone of disappointment. It was nothing like what
"he had imagined. There was not much mystery about it. Often, since"
"running away from home, he had passed nights in deserted temples"
like this. It was not a bad place for playing hide-and-seek; still
it was quite possible that his comrades might track him there.

"From the middle of the floor inside, Jaganath removed a slab of stone,"
and an underground room with a lamp burning in it was revealed to the
astonished eyes of the boy. Fear and curiosity assailed his little
heart. Jaganath descended by a ladder and Nitai followed him.

"Looking around, the boy saw that there were brass  ghurras [17] on all"
"sides of him. In the middle lay spread an  assan [18], and in front of"
"it were arranged vermilion, sandal paste, flowers, and other articles"
of  puja . To satisfy his curiosity the boy dipped his hand into some
"of the  ghurras , and drew out their contents. They were rupees and"
gold  mohurs .

  [17] A water-pot holding about three gallons of water.

  [18] A prayer carpet.

"Jaganath, addressing the boy, said: 'I told you, Nitai, that I would"
"give you all my money. I have not got much,--these  ghurras  are all"
that I possess. These I will make over to you to-day.'

The boy jumped with delight. 'All?' he exclaimed; 'you won't take
"back a rupee, will you?'"

"'If I do,' said the old man in solemn tones, 'may my hand be"
"attacked with leprosy. But there is one condition. If ever my grandson,"
"Gokul Chandra, or his son, or his grandson, or his great-grandson or"
"any of his progeny should happen to pass this way, then you must"
"make over to him, or to them, every rupee and every  mohur  here.'"

"The boy thought that the old man was raving. 'Very well,' he replied."

"Then sit on this  assan ,' said Jaganath."

'What for?'

Because  puja  will be done to you.'

"'But why?' said the boy, taken aback."

'This is the rule.'

The boy squatted on the  assan  as he was told. Jaganath smeared
"his forehead with sandal paste, put a mark of vermilion between his"
"eyebrows, flung a garland of flowers round his neck, and began to"
recite  mantras .[19]

  [19] Incantations.

"To sit there like a god, and hear  mantras  recited made poor Nitai"
"feel very uneasy. 'Grandfather,' he whispered."

"But Jaganath did not reply, and went on muttering his incantations."

"Finally, with great difficulty he dragged each  ghurra  before the boy"
and made him repeat the following vow after him:

'I do solemnly promise that I will make over all this treasure to
"Gokul Chandra Kundu, the son of Brindaban Kundu, the grandson of"
"Jaganath Kundu, or to the son or to the grandson or to the"
"great-grandson of the said Gokul Chandra Kundu, or to any other"
progeny of his who may be the rightful heir.'

"The boy repeated this over and over again, until he felt stupefied,"
and his tongue began to grow stiff in his mouth. When the ceremony was
"over, the air of the cave was laden with the smoke of the earthen lamp"
and the breath-poison of the two. The boy felt that the roof of his
"mouth had become dry as dust, and his hands and feet were burning. He"
was nearly suffocated.

"The lamp became dimmer and dimmer, and then went out altogether. In the"
"total darkness that followed, Nitai could hear the old man climbing up"
"the ladder. 'Grandfather, where are you going to?' said he, greatly"
distressed.

"'I am going now,' replied Jaganath; 'you remain here. No one will"
"be able to find you. Remember the name Gokul Chandra, the son of"
"Brindaban, and the grandson of Jaganath.'"

"He then withdrew the ladder. In a stifled, agonised voice the boy"
implored: 'I want to go back to father.'

Jaganath replaced the slab. He then knelt down and placed his ear
on the stone. Nitai's voice was heard once more--'Father'--and
then came a sound of some heavy object falling with a bump--and
then--everything was still.

"Having thus placed his wealth in the hands of a  yak ,[20] Jaganath"
began to cover up the stone with earth. Then he piled broken bricks
and loose mortar over it. On the top of all he planted turfs of
"grass and jungle weeds. The night was almost spent, but he could not"
tear himself away from the spot. Now and again he placed his ear
"to the ground, and tried to listen. It seemed to him that from far"
far below--from the abysmal depth of the earth's interior--came a
wailing. It seemed to him that the night-sky was flooded with that
"one sound, that the sleeping humanity of all the world was awake, and"
"was sitting on its beds, trying to listen."

  [20]  Yak  or  Yaksa  is a supernatural being described in Sanskrit
"  mythology and poetry. In Bengal,  Yak  has come to mean a ghostly"
"  custodian of treasure, under such circumstances as in this story."

The old man in his frenzy kept on heaping earth higher and higher. He
"wanted somehow to stifle that sound, but still he fancied he could hear"
'Father.'

He struck the spot with all his might and said: 'Be quiet--people
might hear you.' But still he imagined he heard 'Father.'

"The sun lighted up the eastern horizon. Jaganath then left the temple,"
and came into the open fields.

"There, too, somebody called out 'Father.' Startled at the sound, he"
turned back and saw his son at his heels.

"'Father,' said Brindaban, 'I hear my boy is hiding himself in your"
house. I must have him back.'

"With eyes dilated and distorted mouth, the old man leaned forward and"
exclaimed: 'Your boy?'

"'Yes, my boy Gokul. He is Nitai Pal now, and I myself go by the name"
"of Damodar Pal. Your  fame  has spread so widely in the neighbourhood,"
"that we were obliged to cover up our origin, lest people should have"
refused to pronounce our names.'

Slowly the old man lifted both his arms above his head. His fingers
"began to twitch convulsively, as though he was trying to catch hold of"
some imaginary object in the air. He then fell on the ground.

"When he came to his senses again, he dragged his son towards the ruined"
"temple. When they were both inside it, he said: 'Do you hear any"
wailing sound?'

"'No, I don't,' said Brindaban."

'Just listen very carefully. Do you hear anybody calling out
"""Father""?'"

'No.'

This seemed to relieve him greatly.

"From that day forward, he used to go about asking people: 'Do you hear"
any wailing sound?' They laughed at the raving dotard.

"About four years later, Jaganath lay on his death-bed. When the"
"light of this world was gradually fading away from his eyes, and his"
"breathing became more and more difficult, he suddenly sat up in a"
state of delirium. Throwing both his hands in the air he seemed to
"grope about for something, muttering: 'Nitai, who has removed my"
ladder?'

"Unable to find the ladder to climb out of his terrible dungeon, where"
"there was no light to see and no air to breathe, he fell on his bed"
"once more, and disappeared into that region where no one has ever been"
found out in the world's eternal game of hide-and-seek.[21]

"  [21] The incidents described in this story, now happily a thing of"
"  the past, were by no means rare in Bengal at one time. Our author,"
"  however, slightly departs from the current accounts. Such criminally"
  superstitious practices were resorted to by miserly persons under the
  idea that they themselves would re-acquire the treasure in a future
  state of existence. 'When you see me in a future birth passing this
"  way, you must make over all this treasure to me. Guard it till then"
"  and stir not,'--was the usual promise exacted from the victim before"
  he became  yak . Many were the 'true' stories we heard in childhood of
  people becoming suddenly rich by coming across ghostly custodians of
  wealth belonging to them in a past birth.




THE RIDDLE SOLVED


I

"Krishna Gopal Sircar, zemindar of Jhikrakota, made over his estates to"
"his eldest son, and retired to Kasi, as befits a good Hindu, to spend"
the evening of his life in religious devotion. All the poor and the
destitute of the neighbourhood were in tears at the parting. Every one
declared that such piety and benevolence were rare in these degenerate
days.

"His son, Bipin Bihari, was a young man well educated after the modern"
"fashion, and had taken the degree of Bachelor of Arts. He sported a"
"pair of spectacles, wore a beard, and seldom mixed with others. His"
"private life was unsullied. He did not smoke, and never touched"
"cards. He was a man of stern disposition, though he looked soft and"
pliable. This trait of his character soon came home to his tenantry
"in diverse ways. Unlike his father, he would on no account allow the"
remission of one single pice out of the rents justly due to him.
In no circumstances would he grant any tenant one single day's grace
in paying up.

"On taking over the management of the property, Bipin Bihari discovered"
that his father had allowed a large number of Brahmins to hold land
"entirely rent-free, and a larger number at rents much below the"
prevailing rates. His father was incapable of resisting the importunate
solicitation of others--such was the weakness of his character.

Bipin Bihari said this could never be. He could not abandon the
income of half his property--and he reasoned with himself thus:
" Firstly , the persons who were in actual enjoyment of the concessions"
"and getting fat at his expense were a lot of worthless people, and"
wholly undeserving of charity. Charity bestowed on such objects only
"encouraged idleness.  Secondly , living nowadays had become much"
costlier than in the days of his ancestors. Wants had increased apace.
For a gentleman to keep up his position had become four times as
expensive as in days past. So he could not afford to scatter gifts
"right and left as his father had done. On the contrary, it was his"
bounden duty to call back as many of them as he possibly could.

So Bipin Bihari lost no time in carrying into effect what he conceived
to be his duty. He was a man of strict principles.

"What had gone out of his grasp, returned to him little by little. Only"
a very small portion of his father's grants did he allow to remain
"undisturbed, and he took good care to arrange that even those should"
not be deemed permanent.

The wails of the tenants reached Krishna Gopal at Benares through the
post. Some even made a journey to that place to represent their
grievances to him in person. Krishna Gopal wrote to his son intimating
"his displeasure. Bipin Bihari replied, pointing out that the times"
"had changed. In former days, he said, the  zemindar  was compensated"
for the gifts he made by the many customary presents he received from
his tenantry. Recent statutes had made all such impositions illegal.
The  zemindar  had now to rest content with just the stipulated
"rent, and nothing more. 'Unless,' he continued, 'we keep a strict"
"watch over the payment of our just dues, what will be left to us?"
"Since the tenants won't give us anything extra now, how can we allow"
them concessions? Our relations must henceforth be strictly commercial.
"We shall be ruined if we go on making gifts and endowments, and the"
preservation of our property and the keeping up of our position will be
rendered very difficult.'

Krishna Gopal became uneasy at finding that times should have changed
"so much. 'Well, well,' he murmured to himself, 'the younger"
"generation knows best, I suppose. Our old-fashioned methods won't"
"do now. If I interfere, my son might refuse to manage the property,"
"and insist on my going back. No, thank you--I would rather not. I"
prefer to devote the few days that are left me to the service of my
God.'


II

So things went on. Bipin Bihari put his affairs in order after much
"litigation in the Courts, and by less constitutional methods outside."
Most of the tenants submitted to his will out of fear. Only a fellow
"called Asimuddin, son of Mirza Bibi, remained refractory."

Bipin's displeasure was keenest against this man. He could quite
"understand his father having granted rent-free lands to Brahmins, but"
"why this Mohammedan should be holding so much land, some free and"
"some at rents lower than the prevailing rates, was a riddle to him."
"And what was he? The son of a low Mohammedan widow, giving himself"
"airs and defying the whole world, simply because he had learnt to read"
and write a little at the village school. To Bipin it was intolerable.

He made inquiries of his clerks about Asimuddin's holdings. All that
they could tell him was that Babu Krishna Gopal himself had made
"these grants to the family many years back, but they had no idea"
"as to what his motive might have been. They imagined, however, that"
"perhaps the widow won the compassion of the kind-hearted  zemindar , by"
representing to him her woe and misery.

To Bipin these favours seemed to be utterly undeserved. He had not
seen the pitiable condition of these people in days gone by. Their
comparative ease at the present day and their arrogance drove him to
the conclusion that they had impudently swindled his tender-hearted
father out of a part of his lawful income.

"Asimuddin was a stiff-necked sort of a fellow, too. He vowed that he"
would lay down his life sooner than give up an inch of his land. Then
came open hostilities.

The poor old widow tried her best to pacify her son. 'It is no good
"fighting with the  zemindar ,' she would often say to him. 'His"
"kindness has kept us alive so long; let us depend upon him still,"
though he may curtail his favours. Surrender to him part of the lands
as he desires.'

"'Oh, mother!' protested Asimuddin. 'What do you know of these"
"matters, pray?'"

"One by one, Asimuddin lost the cases instituted against him. The more"
"he lost, the more his obstinacy increased. For the sake of his all,"
he staked all that was his.

"One afternoon, Mirza Bibi collected some fruits and vegetables from"
"her little garden, and unknown to her son went and sought an interview"
with Bipin Babu. She looked at him with a tenderness maternal in its
"intensity, and spoke: 'May Allah bless you, my son. Do not destroy"
Asim--it wouldn't be right of you. To your charge I commit him.
Take him as though he were one whom it is your duty to support--as
though he were a ne'er-do-well younger brother of yours. Vast is
"your wealth--don't grudge him a small particle of it, my son.'"

This assumption of familiarity on the part of the garrulous old woman
"annoyed Bipin not a little. 'What do you know of these things, my good"
woman?' he condescended to say. 'If you have any representations
"to make, send your son to me.'"

Being assured for the second time that she knew nothing about these
"affairs, Mirza Bibi returned home, wiping her eyes with her apron all"
"the way, and offering her silent prayers to Allah."


III

The litigation dragged its weary length from the Criminal to the
"Civil Courts, and thence to the High Court, where at last Asimuddin"
met with a partial success. Eighteen months passed in this way. But he
was a ruined man now--plunged in debts up to his very ears. His
creditors took this opportunity to execute the decrees they had
obtained against him. A date was fixed for putting up to auction every
stick and stone that he had left.

It was Monday. The village market had assembled by the side of a tiny
"river, now swollen by the rains. Buying and selling were going on,"
partly on the bank and partly in the boats moored there. The hubbub was
"great. Among the commodities for sale jack-fruits preponderated, it"
being the month of  Asadh .  Hilsa  fish were seen in large quantities
"also. The sky was cloudy. Many of the stall-holders, apprehending a"
"downpour, had stretched a piece of cloth overhead, across bamboo"
poles put up for the purpose.

Asimuddin had come too--but he had not a copper with him. No
shopkeepers allowed him credit nowadays. He therefore had brought a
"brass  thali [22] and a  dao [23] with him. These he would pawn,"
and then buy what he needed.

  [22]  Thali : plate.

  [23]  Dao : knife.

"Towards evening, Bipin Babu was out for a walk attended by two or"
"three retainers armed with  lathis .[24] Attracted by the noise, he"
"directed his steps towards the market. On his arrival, he stopped"
"awhile before the stall of Dwari, the oilman, and made kindly inquiries"
"about his business. All on a sudden, Asimuddin raised his  dao  and"
"ran towards Bipin Babu, roaring like a tiger. The market people"
"caught hold of him half-way, and quickly disarmed him. He was forthwith"
given in custody to the police. Business in the market then went on as
usual.

  [24]  Lathis : stick.

We cannot say that Bipin Babu was not inwardly pleased at this
incident. It is intolerable that the creature we are hunting down
"should turn and show fight. 'The  badmash ,' Bipin chuckled; 'I"
have got him at last.'

"The ladies of Bipin Babu's house, when they heard the news, exclaimed"
"with horror: 'Oh, the ruffian! What a mercy they seized him in time!'"
They found consolation in the prospect of the man being punished as
he richly deserved.

In another part of the village the same evening the widow's humble
"cottage, devoid of bread and bereft of her son, became darker than"
"death. Others dismissed the incident of the afternoon from their minds,"
"sat down to their meals, retired to bed and went to sleep, but to"
the widow the event loomed larger than anything else in this wide
"world. But, alas, who was there to combat it? Only a bundle of wearied"
bones and a helpless mother's heart trembling with fear.


IV

Three days have passed in the meanwhile. To-morrow the case would come
up for trial before a Deputy Magistrate. Bipin Babu would have to be
examined as a witness. Never before this did a  zemindar  of Jhikrakota
"appear in the witness-box, but Bipin did not mind."

"The next day at the appointed hour, Bipin Babu arrived at the Court"
"in a palanquin in great state. He wore a turban on his head, and a"
watch-chain dangled on his breast. The Deputy Magistrate invited him
"to a seat on the das, beside his own. The Court-room was crowded to"
suffocation. So great a sensation had not been witnessed in this Court
for many years.

"When the time for the case to be called drew near, a  chaprassi  came"
and whispered something in Bipin Babu's ear. He got up very agitated
"and walked out, begging the Deputy Magistrate to excuse him for a few"
minutes.

"Outside he saw his old father a little way off, standing under a"
" banian  tree, barefooted and wrapped in a piece of  namabali .[25]"
A string of beads was in his hand. His slender form shone with a gentle
"lustre, and tranquil compassion seemed to radiate from his forehead."

  [25] A garment with the name of Krishna printed over it.

"Bipin, hampered by his close-fitting trousers and his flowing"
" chapkan , touched his father's feet with his forehead. As he did"
"this his turban came off and kissed his nose, and his watch, popping"
"out of his pocket, swung to and fro in the air. Bipin hurriedly"
"straightened his turban, and begged his father to come to his pleader's"
house close by.

"'No, thank you,' Krishna Gopal replied, 'I will tell you here what"
I have got to say.'

A curious crowd had gathered by this time. Bipin's attendants pushed
them back.

Then Krishna Gopal said: 'You must do what you can to get Asim
"acquitted, and restore him the lands that you have taken away from"
him.'

"'Is it for this, father,' said Bipin, very much surprised, 'that you"
have come all the way from Benares? Would you tell me why you have made
these people the objects of your special favour?'

"'What would you gain by knowing it, my boy?'"

"But Bipin persisted. 'It is only this, father,' he went on; 'I have"
revoked many a grant because I thought the tenants were not deserving.
"There were many Brahmins among them, but of them you never said a"
word. Why are you so keen about these Mohammedans now? After all that
"has happened, if I drop this case against Asim, and give him back his"
"lands, what shall I say to people?'"

"Krishna Gopal kept silence for some moments. Then, passing the beads"
"through his shaky fingers with rapidity, he spoke with a tremulous"
"voice: 'Should it be necessary to explain your conduct to people,"
you may tell them that Asimuddin is my son--and your brother.'

'What?' exclaimed Bipin in painful surprise. 'From a Musalman's
womb?'

"'Even so, my son,' was the calm reply."

Bipin stood there for some time in mute astonishment. Then he found
"words to say: 'Come home, father; we will talk about it afterwards.'"

"'No, my son,' replied the old man, 'having once relinquished the"
"world to serve my God, I cannot go home again. I return hence. Now I"
leave you to do what your sense of duty may suggest.' He then blessed
"his son, and, checking his tears with difficulty, walked off with"
tottering steps.

"Bipin was dumbfounded, not knowing what to say nor what to do. 'So,"
"such was the piety of the older generation,' he said to himself. He"
reflected with pride how much better he was than his father in point
"of education and morality. This was the result, he concluded, of not"
having a principle to guide one's actions.

"Returning to the Court, he saw Asimuddin outside between two"
"constables, awaiting his trial. He looked emaciated and worn out."
"His lips were pale and dry, and his eyes unnaturally bright. A dirty"
piece of cloth worn to shreds covered him. 'This my brother!' Bipin
shuddered at the thought.

"The Deputy Magistrate and Bipin were friends, and the case ended in a"
fiasco. In a few days Asimuddin was restored to his former condition.
"Why all this happened, he could not understand. The village people were"
greatly surprised also.

"However, the news of Krishna Gopal's arrival just before the trial"
soon got abroad. People began to exchange meaning glances. The
"pleaders in their shrewdness guessed the whole affair. One of them,"
"Ram Taran Babu, was beholden to Krishna Gopal for his education and"
his start in life. Somehow or other he had always suspected that
the virtue and piety of his benefactor were shams. Now he was fully
"convinced that, if a searching inquiry were made, all 'pious' men"
might be found out. 'Let them tell their beads as much as they
"like,' he thought with glee, 'everybody in this world is just as"
bad as myself. The only difference between a good and a bad man is
that the good practise dissimulation while the bad don't.' The
"revelation that Krishna Gopal's far-famed piety, benevolence, and"
"magnanimity were nothing but a cloak of hypocrisy, settled a difficulty"
that had oppressed Ram Taran Babu for many years. By what process
"of reasoning, we do not know, the burden of gratitude was greatly"
lifted off his mind. It was a vast relief to him!




THE ELDER SISTER


I

Having described at length the misdeeds of an unfortunate woman's
"wicked, tyrannical husband, Tara, the woman's neighbour in the village,"
very shortly declared her verdict: 'Fire be to such a husband's
mouth.'

At this Joygopal Babu's wife felt much hurt; it did not become
"womankind to wish, in any circumstances whatever, a worse species"
of fire than that of a cigar in a husband's mouth.

"When, therefore, she mildly disapproved the verdict, hard-hearted Tara"
cried with redoubled vehemence: ''Twere better to be a widow seven
"births over than the wife of such a husband,' and saying this she"
broke up the meeting and left.

Sasi said within herself: 'I can't imagine any offence in a husband
that could so harden the heart against him.' Even as she turned
"the matter over in her mind, all the tenderness of her loving soul"
gushed forth towards her own husband now abroad. Throwing herself with
outstretched arms on that part of the bed whereon her husband was wont
"to lie, she kissed the empty pillow, caught the smell of her husband's"
"head, and, shutting the door, brought out from a wooden box an old and"
"almost faded photograph with some letters in his handwriting, and sat"
gazing upon them. Thus she passed the hushed noontide alone in her
"room, musing of old memories and shedding tears of sadness."

It was no new yoke this between Sasikala and Joygopal. They had been
married at an early age and had children. Their long companionship
"had made the days go by in an easy, commonplace sort of way. On"
neither side had there been any symptoms of excessive passion. They
"had lived together nearly sixteen years without a break, when her"
"husband was suddenly called away from home on business, and then a"
great impulse of love awoke in Sasi's soul. As separation strained
"the tie, love's knot grew tighter, and the passion, whose existence"
"Sasi had not felt, now made her throb with pain."

"So it happened that after so many long years, and at such an age,"
"and being the mother of children, Sasi, on this spring noon, in her"
"lonely chamber, lying on the bed of separation, began to dream the"
sweet dream of a bride in her budding youth. That love of which
hitherto she had been unconscious suddenly aroused her with its
"murmuring music. She wandered a long way up the stream, and saw many a"
golden mansion and many a grove on either bank; but no foothold could
she find now amid the vanished hopes of happiness. She began to
"say to herself that, when next she met her husband, life should not"
"be insipid nor should the spring come in vain. How very often, in idle"
"disputation or some petty quarrel, had she teased her husband! With"
all the singleness of a penitent heart she vowed that she would never
"show impatience again, never oppose her husband's wishes, bear all"
"his commands, and with a tender heart submit to whatever he wished of"
"good or ill; for the husband was all-in-all, the husband was the"
"dearest object of love, the husband was divine."

Sasikala was the only and much-petted daughter of her parents. For this
"reason, though he had only a small property of his own, Joygopal had no"
anxieties about the future. His father-in-law had enough to support
them in a village with royal state.

And then in his old age a son was born untimely to Sasikala's
"father. To tell the truth, Sasi was very sore in her mind at this"
"unlooked-for, improper, and unjust action of her parents; nor was"
Joygopal particularly pleased.

"The parents' love centred in this son of their advanced years, and"
"when the newly arrived, diminutive, sleepy brother-in-law seized with"
"his two weak tiny fists all the hopes and expectations of Joygopal,"
Joygopal found a place in a tea-garden in Assam.

"His friends urged him to look for employment hard-by, but whether out"
"of a general feeling of resentment, or knowing the chances of rapid"
"rise in a tea-garden, Joygopal would not pay heed to anybody. He sent"
"his wife and children to his father-in-law's, and left for Assam. It"
was the first separation between husband and wife in their married life.

This incident made Sasikala very angry with her baby brother. The
soreness which may not pass the lips is felt the more keenly within.
"When the little fellow sucked and slept at his ease, his big sister"
"found a hundred reasons, such as the rice is cold, the boys are too"
"late for school, to worry herself and others, day and night, with her"
petulant humours.

"But in a short time the child's mother died. Before her death, she"
committed her infant son to her daughter's care.

Then did the motherless child easily conquer his sister's heart. With
"loud whoops he would fling himself upon her, and with right good-will"
"try to get her mouth, nose, eyes within his own tiny mouth; he would"
seize her hair within his little fists and refuse to give it up;
"awaking before the dawn, he would roll over to her side and thrill her"
"with his soft touch, and babble like a noisy brook; later on, he"
"would call her  jiji  and  jijima , and in hours of work and rest, by"
"doing forbidden things, eating forbidden food, going to forbidden"
"places, would set up a regular tyranny over her; then Sasi could"
resist no longer. She surrendered herself completely to this wayward
"little tyrant. Since the child had no mother, his influence over her"
became the greater.


II

The child was named Nilmani. When he was two years old his father
fell seriously ill. A letter reached Joygopal asking him to come as
"quickly as possible. When after much trouble he got leave and arrived,"
Kaliprasanna's last hour had come.

Before he died Kaliprasanna entrusted Joygopal with the charge of his
"son, and left a quarter of his estate to his daughter."

"So Joygopal gave up his appointment, and came home to look after his"
property.

After a long time husband and wife met again. When a material body
breaks it may be put together again. But when two human beings are
"divided, after a long separation, they never re-unite at the same"
"place, and to the same time; for the mind is a living thing, and moment"
by moment it grows and changes.

In Sasi reunion stirred a new emotion. The numbness of age-long habit
in their old marriage was entirely removed by the longing born of
"separation, and she seemed to win her husband much more closely than"
"before. Had she not vowed in her mind that whatever days might come,"
"and how long soever they might be, she would never let the brightness"
of this glowing love for her husband be dimmed.

"Of this reunion, however, Joygopal felt differently. When they were"
constantly together before he had been bound to his wife by his
interests and idiosyncrasies. His wife was then a living truth in his
"life, and there would have been a great rent in the web of his daily"
habit if she were left out. Consequently Joygopal found himself in
deep waters at first when he went abroad. But in time this breach in
habit was patched up by a new habit.

And this was not all. Formerly his days went by in the most indolent
"and careless fashion. For the last two years, the stimulus of bettering"
his condition had stirred so powerfully in his breast that he had
nothing else in his thoughts. As compared with the intensity of this
"new passion, his old life seemed like an unsubstantial shadow. The"
"greatest changes in a woman's nature are wrought by love; in a man's,"
by ambition.

"Joygopal, when he returned after two years, found his wife not quite"
the same as of old. To her life his infant brother-in-law had added a
new breadth. This part of her life was wholly unfamiliar to him--here
he had no communion with his wife. His wife tried hard to share her
"love for the child with him, but it cannot be said that she succeeded."
"Sasi would come with the child in her arms, and hold him before her"
"husband with a smiling face--Nilmani would clasp Sasi's neck, and hide"
"his face on her shoulder, and admit no obligation of kindred. Sasi"
wished that her little brother might show Joygopal all the arts he had
learnt to capture a man's mind. But Joygopal was not very keen about
it. How could the child show any enthusiasm? Joygopal could not at all
"understand what there was in the heavy-pated, grave-faced, dusky"
child that so much love should be wasted on him.

Women quickly understand the ways of love. Sasi at once understood that
Joygopal did not care for Nilmani. Henceforth she used to screen her
"brother with the greatest care--to keep him away from the unloving,"
repelling look of her husband. Thus the child came to be the treasure
"of her secret care, the object of her isolated love."

Joygopal was greatly annoyed when Nilmani cried; so Sasi would quickly
"press the child to her breast, and with her whole heart and soul try"
to soothe him. And when Nilmani's cry happened to disturb Joygopal's
"sleep at night, and Joygopal with an expression of displeasure, and"
"in a tortured spirit, growled at the child, Sasi felt humbled and"
fluttered like a guilty thing. Then she would take up the child in
"her lap, retire to a distance, and in a voice of pleading love, with"
"such endearments as 'my gold, my treasure, my jewel,' lull him to"
sleep.

"Children will fall out for a hundred things. Formerly in such cases,"
"Sasi would punish her children, and side with her brother, for he was"
motherless. Now the law changed with the judge. Nilmani had often to
bear heavy punishment without fault and without inquiry. This wrong
went like a dagger to Sasi's heart; so she would take her punished
"brother into her room, and with sweets and toys, and by caressing and"
"kissing him, solace as much as she could his stricken heart."

"Thus the more Sasi loved Nilmani, the more Joygopal was annoyed with"
"him. On the other hand, the more Joygopal showed his contempt for"
"Nilmani, the more would Sasi bathe the child with the nectar of her"
love.

"And when the fellow Joygopal behaved harshly to his wife, Sasi would"
"minister to him silently, meekly, and with loving-kindness. But"
"inwardly they hurt each other, moment by moment, about Nilmani."

The hidden clash of a silent conflict like this is far harder to bear
than an open quarrel.


III

Nilmani's head was the largest part of him. It seemed as if the Creator
had blown through a slender stick a big bubble at its top. The doctors
feared sometimes that the child might be as frail and as quickly
evanescent as a bubble. For a long time he could neither speak nor
"walk. Looking at his sad grave face, you might think that his parents"
had unburdened all the sad weight of their advanced years upon the head
of this little child.

"With his sister's care and nursing, Nilmani passed the period of"
"danger, and arrived at his sixth year."

"In the month of Kartik, on the  bhaiphoto [26] day, Sasi had dressed"
"Nilmani up as a little Babu, in coat and  chadar  and red-bordered"
" dhoti , and was giving him the 'brother's mark,' when her outspoken"
"neighbour Tara came in and, for one reason or another, began a quarrel."

  [26] Lit. the 'brother's mark.' A beautiful and touching ceremony in
  which a Hindu sister makes a mark of sandalwood paste on the forehead
"  of her brother and utters a formula, 'putting the barrier in Yama's"
"  doorway' (figurative for wishing long life). On these occasions, the"
"  sisters entertain their brothers and make them presents of clothes,"
  etc.

"''Tis no use,' cried she, 'giving the ""brother's mark"" with so"
much show and ruining the brother in secret.'

"At this Sasi was thunderstruck with astonishment, rage, and pain. Tara"
repeated the rumour that Sasi and her husband had conspired together
"to put the minor Nilmani's property up for sale for arrears of rent,"
and to purchase it in the name of her husband's cousin. When Sasi heard
"this, she uttered a curse that those who could spread such a foul"
lie might be stricken with leprosy in the mouth. And then she went
"weeping to her husband, and told him of the gossip. Joygopal said:"
"'Nobody can be trusted in these days. Upen is my aunt's son, and I"
felt quite safe in leaving him in charge of the property. He could not
have allowed the  taluk  Hasilpur to fall into arrears and purchase it
"himself in secret, if I had had the least inkling about it.'"

'Won't you sue then?' asked Sasi in astonishment.

"'Sue one's cousin!' said Joygopal. 'Besides, it would be useless,"
a simple waste of money.'

"It was Sasi's supreme duty to trust her husband's word, but Sasi could"
"not. At last her happy home, the domesticity of her love seemed"
hateful to her. That home life which had once seemed her supreme
"refuge was nothing more than a cruel snare of self-interest, which had"
"surrounded them, brother and sister, on all sides. She was a woman,"
"single-handed, and she knew not how she could save the helpless"
"Nilmani. The more she thought, the more her heart filled with terror,"
"loathing, and an infinite love for her imperilled little brother. She"
"thought that, if she only knew how, she would appear before the  Lat"
"Saheb ,[27] nay, write to the Maharani herself, to save her brother's"
property. The Maharani would surely not allow Nilmani's  taluk [28]
"of Hasilpur, with an income of seven hundred and fifty-eight rupees a"
"year, to be sold."

  [27] The Viceroy.

  [28] Land.

When Sasi was thus thinking of bringing her husband's cousin to book
"by appealing to the Maharani herself, Nilmani was suddenly seized with"
fever and convulsions.

Joygopal called in the village doctor. When Sasi asked for a better
"doctor, Joygopal said: 'Why, Matilal isn't a bad sort.'"

"Sasi fell at his feet, and charged him with an oath on her own head;"
"whereupon Joygopal said: 'Well, I shall send for the doctor from"
town.'

"Sasi lay with Nilmani in her lap, nor would Nilmani let her out of his"
sight for a minute; he clung to her lest by some pretence she should
escape; even while he slept he would not loosen his hold of her dress.

"Thus the whole day passed, and Joygopal came after nightfall to say"
that the doctor was not at home; he had gone to see a patient at a
distance. He added that he himself had to leave that very day on
"account of a lawsuit, and that he had told Matilal, who would regularly"
call to see the patient.

"At night Nilmani wandered in his sleep. As soon as the morning dawned,"
"Sasi, without the least scruple, took a boat with her sick brother, and"
went straight to the doctor's house. The doctor was at home--he had not
"left the town. He quickly found lodgings for her, and having installed"
"her under the care of an elderly widow, undertook the treatment of"
the boy.

"The next day Joygopal arrived. Blazing with fury, he ordered his wife"
to return home with him at once.

"'Even if you cut me to pieces, I won't return,' replied his wife."
"'You all want to kill my Nilmani, who has no father, no mother, none"
"other than me, but I will save him.'"

"'Then you remain here, and don't come back to my house,' cried"
Joygopal indignantly.

"Sasi at length fired up. ' Your  house! Why, 'tis my brother's!'"

"'All right, we'll see,' said Joygopal. The neighbours made a great"
"stir over this incident. 'If you want to quarrel with your husband,'"
"said Tara, 'do so at home. What is the good of leaving your house?"
"After all, Joygopal is your husband.'"

"By spending all the money she had with her, and selling her ornaments,"
Sasi saved her brother from the jaws of death. Then she heard that the
"big property which they had in Dwarigram, where their dwelling-house"
"stood, the income of which was more than Rs. 1500 a year, had been"
transferred by Joygopal into his own name with the help of the
"Jemindar. And now the whole property belonged to them, not to her"
brother.

"When he had recovered from his illness, Nilmani would cry plaintively:"
"'Let us go home, sister.' His heart was pining for his nephews and"
"nieces, his companions. So he repeatedly said: 'Let us go home,"
"sister, to that old house of ours.' At this Sasi wept. Where was"
their home?

But it was no good crying. Her brother had no one else besides herself
"in the world. Sasi thought of this, wiped her tears, and, entering the"
"Zenana of the Deputy Magistrate, Tarini Babu, appealed to his wife."
The Deputy Magistrate knew Joygopal. That a woman should forsake her
"home, and engage in a dispute with her husband regarding matters of"
"property, greatly incensed him against Sasi. However, Tarini Babu"
"kept Sasi diverted, and instantly wrote to Joygopal. Joygopal put"
"his wife and brother-in-law into a boat by force, and brought them home."

"Husband and wife, after a second separation, met again for the second"
time! The decree of Prajapati![29]

  [29] The Hindu god of marriage.

"Having got back his old companions after a long absence, Nilmani was"
"perfectly happy. Seeing his unsuspecting joy, Sasi felt as if her heart"
would break.


IV

The Magistrate was touring in the Mofussil during the cold weather and
pitched his tent within the village to shoot. The Saheb met Nilmani on
"the village  maidan . The other boys gave him a wide berth, varying"
"Chanakya's couplet a little, and adding the Saheb to the list of 'the"
"clawed, the toothed, and the horned beasts.' But grave-natured Nilmani"
in imperturbable curiosity serenely gazed at the Saheb.

The Saheb was amused and came up and asked in Bengali: 'You read at
the  pathsala ?'

The boy silently nodded. 'What  pustaks [30] do you read?' asked the
Saheb.

  [30] A literary word for books. The colloquial will be  boi .

"As Nilmani did not understand the word  pustak , he silently fixed his"
gaze on the Magistrate's face. Nilmani told his sister the story of
his meeting the Magistrate with great enthusiasm.

"At noon, Joygopal, dressed in trousers,  chapkan ,[31] and"
" pagri ,[32] went to pay his salams to the Saheb. A crowd of suitors,"
" chaprasies ,[33] and constables stood about him. Fearing the"
"heat, the Saheb had seated himself at a court-table outside the tent,"
"in the open shade, and placing Joygopal in a chair, questioned him"
about the state of the village. Having taken the seat of honour in
"open view of the community, Joygopal swelled inwardly, and thought"
it would be a good thing if any of the Chakrabartis or Nandis came
and saw him there.

  [31] A  chapkan  is a long coat.

  [32] Turban.

  [33] Servants.

"At this moment, a woman, closely veiled, and accompanied by Nilmani,"
"came straight up to the Magistrate. She said: 'Saheb, into your"
"hands I resign my helpless brother. Save him.' The Saheb, seeing the"
"large-headed, solemn boy, whose acquaintance he had already made, and"
"thinking that the woman must be of a respectable family, at once stood"
up and said: 'Please enter the tent.'

The woman said: 'What I have to say I will say here.'

Joygopal writhed and turned pale. The curious villagers thought it
"capital fun, and pressed closer. But the moment the Saheb lifted his"
cane they scampered off.

"Holding her brother by the hand, Sasi narrated the history of the"
orphan from the beginning. As Joygopal tried to interrupt now and
"then, the Magistrate thundered with a flushed face, ' Chup rao ,' and"
with the tip of his cane motioned to Joygopal to leave the chair and
stand up.

"Joygopal, inwardly raging against Sasi, stood speechless. Nilmani"
"nestled up close to his sister, and listened awe-struck."

"When Sasi had finished her story, the Magistrate put a few questions to"
"Joygopal, and on hearing his answers, kept silence for a long while,"
"and then addressed Sasi thus: 'My good woman, though this matter"
"may not come up before me, still rest assured I will do all that is"
needful about it. You can return home with your brother without the
least misgiving.'

"Sasi said: 'Saheb, so long as he does not get back his own home, I"
"dare not take him there. Unless you keep Nilmani with you, none else"
will be able to save him.'

'And what would you do?' queried the Saheb.

"'I will retire to my husband's house,' said Sasi; 'there is nothing"
to fear for me.'

"The Saheb smiled a little, and, as there was nothing else to do, agreed"
"to take charge of this lean, dusty, grave, sedate, gentle Bengali boy"
whose neck was ringed with amulets.

"When Sasi was about to take her leave, the boy clutched her dress."
"Don't be frightened,  baba ,--come,' said the Saheb. With tears"
"streaming behind her veil, Sasi said: 'Do go, my brother, my darling"
brother--you will meet your sister again!'

"Saying this she embraced him and stroked his head and back, and"
"releasing her dress, hastily withdrew; and just then the Saheb put his"
"left arm round him. The child wailed out: 'Sister, oh, my sister!'"
"Sasi turned round at once, and with outstretched arm made a sign of"
"speechless solace, and with a bursting heart withdrew."

"Again in that old, ever-familiar house husband and wife met. The decree"
of Prajapati!

But this union did not last long. For soon after the villagers learnt
"one morning that Sasi had died of cholera in the night, and had been"
instantly cremated.

None uttered a word about it. Only neighbour Tara would sometimes
"be on the point of bursting out, but people would shut up her mouth,"
"saying, 'Hush!'"

"At parting, Sasi gave her word to her brother they would meet again."
Where that word was kept none can tell.




SUBHA


"When the girl was given the name of Subhashini,[34] who could have"
guessed that she would prove dumb? Her two elder sisters were
"Sukeshini[35] and Suhasini,[36] and for the sake of uniformity her"
father named his youngest girl Subhashini. She was called Subha for
short.

  [34] Sweetly speaking.

  [35] Lovely-locked.

  [36] Sweetly smiling.

Her two elder sisters had been married with the usual cost and
"difficulty, and now the youngest daughter lay like a silent weight"
"upon the heart of her parents. All the world seemed to think that,"
"because she did not speak, therefore she did not feel; it discussed"
her future and its own anxiety freely in her presence. She had
understood from her earliest childhood that God had sent her like a
"curse to her father's house, so she withdrew herself from ordinary"
"people, and tried to live apart. If only they would all forget her she"
felt she could endure it. But who can forget pain? Night and day
her parents' minds were aching on her account. Especially her mother
looked upon her as a deformity in herself. To a mother a daughter is
a more closely intimate part of herself than a son can be; and a
"fault in her is a source of personal shame. Banikantha, Subha's"
"father, loved her rather better than his other daughters; her mother"
regarded her with aversion as a stain upon her own body.

"If Subha lacked speech, she did not lack a pair of large dark eyes,"
shaded with long lashes; and her lips trembled like a leaf in response
to any thought that rose in her mind.

"When we express our thought in words, the medium is not found easily."
"There must be a process of translation, which is often inexact, and"
then we fall into error. But black eyes need no translating; the mind
"itself throws a shadow upon them. In them thought opens or shuts,"
"shines forth, or goes out in darkness, hangs steadfast like the"
"setting moon, or, like the swift and restless lightning, illumines all"
quarters of the sky. They who from birth have had no other speech
"than the trembling of their lips learn a language of the eyes, endless"
"in expression, deep as the sea, clear as the heavens, wherein play"
"dawn and sunset, light and shadow. The dumb have a lonely grandeur"
"like Nature's own. Wherefore the other children almost dreaded Subha,"
and never played with her. She was silent and companionless as noontide.

"The hamlet where she lived was Chandipur. Its river, small for a river"
"of Bengal, kept to its narrow bounds like a daughter of the middle"
"class. This busy streak of water never overflowed its banks, but went"
about its duties as though it were a member of every family in the
villages beside it. On either side were houses and banks shaded with
"trees. So stepping from her queenly throne, the river-goddess became"
"a garden deity of each home; and forgetful of herself, performed her"
task of endless benediction with swift and cheerful foot.

Banikantha's house looked upon the stream. Every hut and stack in
the place could be seen by the passing boatmen. I know not if amid
"these signs of worldly wealth any one noticed the little girl who,"
"when her work was done, stole away to the waterside, and sat there."
"But here Nature fulfilled her want of speech, and spoke for her."
"The murmur of the brook, the voice of the village folk, the songs"
"of the boatmen, the crying of the birds and rustle of trees mingled,"
and were one with the trembling of her heart. They became one vast
"wave of sound, which beat upon her restless soul. This murmur and"
movement of Nature were the dumb girl's language; that speech of
"the dark eyes, which the long lashes shaded, was the language of"
"the world about her. From the trees, where the cicalas chirped, to"
"the quiet stars there was nothing but signs and gestures, weeping and"
"sighing. And in the deep mid-noon, when the boatmen and fisherfolk"
"had gone to their dinner, when the villagers slept, and birds were"
"still, when the ferry-boats were idle, when the great busy world paused"
"in its toil, and became suddenly a lonely, awful giant, then beneath"
the vast impressive heavens there were only dumb Nature and a dumb
"girl, sitting very silent--one under the spreading sunlight, the"
other where a small tree cast its shadow.

But Subha was not altogether without friends. In the stall were two
"cows, Sarbbashi and Panguli. They had never heard their names from"
"her lips, but they knew her footfall. Though she had no words, she"
murmured lovingly and they understood her gentle murmuring better
"than all speech. When she fondled them or scolded or coaxed them,"
they understood her better than men could do. Subha would come to the
"shed, and throw her arms round Sarbbashi's neck; she would rub her"
"cheek against her friend's, and Panguli would turn her great kind"
eyes and lick her face. The girl paid them three regular visits every
"day, and others that were irregular. Whenever she heard any words"
"that hurt her, she would come to these dumb friends out of due time."
It was as though they guessed her anguish of spirit from her quiet look
"of sadness. Coming close to her, they would rub their horns softly"
"against her arms, and in dumb, puzzled fashion try to comfort her."
"Besides these two, there were goats and a kitten; but Subha had not"
"the same equality of friendship with them, though they showed the"
"same attachment. Every time it got a chance, night or day, the kitten"
"would jump into her lap, and settle down to slumber, and show its"
appreciation of an aid to sleep as Subha drew her soft fingers over its
neck and back.

"Subha had a comrade also among the higher animals, and it is hard to"
"say what were the girl's relations with him, for he could speak, and"
his gift of speech left them without any common language. He was the
"youngest boy of the Gosains, Pratap by name, an idle fellow. After"
"long effort, his parents had abandoned the hope that he would ever"
"make his living. Now losels have this advantage, that, though their"
"own folk disapprove of them, they are generally popular with every"
"one else. Having no work to chain them, they become public property."
"Just as every town needs an open space where all may breathe, so a"
"village needs two or three gentlemen of leisure, who can give time"
"to all; so that, if we are lazy and want a companion, one is to hand."

Pratap's chief ambition was to catch fish. He managed to waste a lot
"of time this way, and might be seen almost any afternoon so employed."
"It was thus most often that he met Subha. Whatever he was about, he"
"liked a companion; and, when one is catching fish, a silent companion"
"is best of all. Pratap respected Subha for her taciturnity, and, as"
"every one called her Subha, he showed his affection by calling her"
"Su. Subha used to sit beneath a tamarind, and Pratap, a little distance"
"off, would cast his line. Pratap took with him a small allowance"
"of betel, and Subha prepared it for him. And I think that, sitting"
"and gazing a long while, she desired ardently to bring some great help"
"to Pratap, to be of real aid, to prove by any means that she was"
not a useless burden to the world. But there was nothing to do. Then
"she turned to the Creator in prayer for some rare power, that by an"
astonishing miracle she might startle Pratap into exclaiming: 'My! I
never dreamt our Su could have done this!'

"Only think! if Subha had been a water nymph, she might have risen"
"slowly from the river, bringing the gem of a snake's crown to the"
"landing-place. Then Pratap, leaving his paltry fishing, might dive"
"into the lower world, and see there, on a golden bed in a palace of"
"silver, whom else but dumb little Su, Banikantha's child? Yes, our"
"Su, the only daughter of the king of that shining city of jewels!"
"But that might not be, it was impossible. Not that anything is"
"really impossible, but Su had been born, not into the royal house of"
"Patalpur,[37] but into Banikantha's family, and she knew no means of"
astonishing the Gosains' boy.

  [37] The Lower World.

Gradually she grew up. Gradually she began to find herself. A new
inexpressible consciousness like a tide from the central places of
"the sea, when the moon is full, swept through her. She saw herself,"
"questioned herself, but no answer came that she could understand."

"Once upon a time, late on a night of full moon, she slowly opened"
"her door, and peeped out timidly. Nature, herself at full moon, like"
"lonely Subha, was looking down on the sleeping earth. Her strong young"
life beat within her; joy and sadness filled her being to its brim;
"she reached the limits even of her own illimitable loneliness, nay,"
"passed beyond them. Her heart was heavy, and she could not speak!"
"At the skirts of this silent, troubled Mother there stood a silent"
troubled girl.

The thought of her marriage filled her parents with an anxious care.
"People blamed them, and even talked of making them outcasts. Banikantha"
was well off; they had fish-curry twice daily; and consequently he
"did not lack enemies. Then the women interfered, and Bani went away"
"for a few days. Presently he returned, and said: 'We must go to"
Calcutta.'

They got ready to go to this strange country. Subha's heart was heavy
"with tears, like a mist-wrapt dawn. With a vague fear that had been"
"gathering for days, she dogged her father and mother like a dumb"
"animal. With her large eyes wide open, she scanned their faces as"
though she wished to learn something. But not a word did they
"vouchsafe. One afternoon in the midst of all this, as Pratap was"
"fishing, he laughed: 'So then, Su, they have caught your bridegroom,"
and you are going to be married! Mind you don't forget me altogether!'
Then he turned his mind again to his fish. As a stricken doe looks
"in the hunter's face, asking in silent agony: 'What have I done to"
you?' so Subha looked at Pratap. That day she sat no longer beneath
"her tree. Banikantha, having finished his nap, was smoking in his"
bedroom when Subha dropped down at his feet and burst out weeping
"as she gazed towards him. Banikantha tried to comfort her, and his"
cheek grew wet with tears.

It was settled that on the morrow they should go to Calcutta. Subha
went to the cow-shed to bid farewell to her childhood's comrades.
She fed them with her hand; she clasped their necks; she looked into
"their faces, and tears fell fast from the eyes which spoke for her."
"That night was the tenth of the moon. Subha left her room, and flung"
herself down on her grassy couch beside her dear river. It was as
"if she threw her arms about Earth, her strong, silent mother, and tried"
"to say: 'Do not let me leave you, mother. Put your arms about me, as"
"I have put mine about you, and hold me fast.'"

"One day in a house in Calcutta, Subha's mother dressed her up with"
"great care. She imprisoned her hair, knotting it up in laces, she"
"hung her about with ornaments, and did her best to kill her natural"
"beauty, Subha's eyes filled with tears. Her mother, fearing they"
"would grow swollen with weeping, scolded her harshly, but the tears"
disregarded the scolding. The bridegroom came with a friend to inspect
the bride. Her parents were dizzy with anxiety and fear when they saw
the god arrive to select the beast for his sacrifice. Behind the
"stage, the mother called her instructions aloud, and increased her"
"daughter's weeping twofold, before she sent her into the examiner's"
"presence. The great man, after scanning her a long time, observed:"
'Not so bad.'

"He took special note of her tears, and thought she must have a tender"
"heart. He put it to her credit in the account, arguing that the heart,"
"which to-day was distressed at leaving her parents, would presently"
"prove a useful possession. Like the oyster's pearls, the child's tears"
"only increased her value, and he made no other comment."

"The almanac was consulted, and the marriage took place on an auspicious"
"day. Having delivered over their dumb girl into another's hands,"
Subha's parents returned home. Thank God! Their caste in this and
their safety in the next world were assured! The bridegroom's work
"lay in the west, and shortly after the marriage he took his wife"
thither.

"In less than ten days every one knew that the bride was dumb! At least,"
"if any one did not, it was not her fault, for she deceived no one. Her"
"eyes told them everything, though no one understood her. She looked"
"on every hand; she found no speech; she missed the faces, familiar"
"from birth, of those who had understood a dumb girl's language. In her"
"silent heart there sounded an endless, voiceless weeping, which only"
the Searcher of Hearts could hear.

"Using both eyes and ears  this  time, her lord made another careful"
"examination, using his ears this time as well as his eyes, and married"
a second wife who could speak.




THE POSTMASTER


The postmaster first took up his duties in the village of Ulapur.
"Though the village was a small one, there was an indigo factory near"
"by, and the proprietor, an Englishman, had managed to get a post office"
established.

Our postmaster belonged to Calcutta. He felt like a fish out of water
in this remote village. His office and living-room were in a dark
"thatched shed, not far from a green, slimy pond, surrounded on all"
sides by a dense growth.

"The men employed in the indigo factory had no leisure; moreover, they"
were hardly desirable companions for decent folk. Nor is a Calcutta
boy an adept in the art of associating with others. Among strangers
"he appears either proud or ill at ease. At any rate, the postmaster"
had but little company; nor had he much to do.

At times he tried his hand at writing a verse or two. That the movement
of the leaves and the clouds of the sky were enough to fill life with
joy--such were the sentiments to which he sought to give expression.
But God knows that the poor fellow would have felt it as the gift of a
"new life, if some genie of the  Arabian Nights  had in one night swept"
"away the trees, leaves and all, and replaced them with a macadamised"
"road, hiding the clouds from view with rows of tall houses."

"The postmaster's salary was small. He had to cook his own meals, which"
"he used to share with Ratan, an orphan girl of the village, who did"
odd jobs for him.

When in the evening the smoke began to curl up from the village
"cow-sheds,[38] and the cicalas chirped in every bush; when the faquirs"
"of the Bal sect sang their shrill songs in their daily meeting-place,"
"when any poet, who had attempted to watch the movement of the leaves in"
"the dense bamboo thickets, would have felt a ghostly shiver run"
"down his back, the postmaster would light his little lamp, and call"
out 'Ratan.'

  [38] Smoky fires are lit in the cow-sheds to drive off mosquitoes.

"Ratan would sit outside waiting for this call, and, instead of coming"
"in at once, would reply: 'Did you call me, sir?'"

'What are you doing?' the postmaster would ask.

"'I must be going to light the kitchen fire,' would be the answer."

"And the postmaster would say: 'Oh, let the kitchen fire be for awhile;"
light me my pipe first.'

"At last Ratan would enter, with puffed-out cheeks, vigorously blowing"
into a flame a live coal to light the tobacco. This would give the
"postmaster an opportunity of conversing. 'Well, Ratan,' perhaps"
"he would begin, 'do you remember anything of your mother?' That was a"
"fertile subject. Ratan partly remembered, and partly didn't. Her"
father had been fonder of her than her mother; him she recollected more
"vividly. He used to come home in the evening after his work, and"
"one or two evenings stood out more clearly than others, like pictures"
in her memory. Ratan would squat on the floor near the postmaster's
"feet, as memories crowded in upon her. She called to mind a little"
brother that she had--and how on some bygone cloudy day she had
"played at fishing with him on the edge of the pond, with a twig for a"
make-believe fishing-rod. Such little incidents would drive out
"greater events from her mind. Thus, as they talked, it would often"
"get very late, and the postmaster would feel too lazy to do any"
"cooking at all. Ratan would then hastily light the fire, and toast"
"some unleavened bread, which, with the cold remnants of the morning"
"meal, was enough for their supper."

"On some evenings, seated at his desk in the corner of the big empty"
"shed, the postmaster too would call up memories of his own home, of"
"his mother and his sister, of those for whom in his exile his heart"
"was sad,--memories which were always haunting him, but which he could"
"not talk about with the men of the factory, though he found himself"
naturally recalling them aloud in the presence of the simple little
girl. And so it came about that the girl would allude to his people
"as mother, brother, and sister,[39] as if she had known them all her"
"life. In fact, she had a complete picture of each one of them painted"
in her little heart.

  [39] Family servants call the master and mistress father and mother
  and the children elder brothers and sisters.

"One noon, during a break in the rains, there was a cool soft breeze"
blowing; the smell of the damp grass and leaves in the hot sun felt
like the warm breathing of the tired earth on one's body. A persistent
bird went on all the afternoon repeating the burden of its one
complaint in Nature's audience chamber.

The postmaster had nothing to do. The shimmer of the freshly washed
"leaves, and the banked-up remnants of the retreating rain-clouds were"
"sights to see; and the postmaster was watching them, and thinking"
"to himself: 'Oh, if only some kindred soul were near--just one loving"
"human being whom I could hold near my heart!' This was exactly, he"
"went on to think, what that bird was trying to say, and it was the"
same feeling which the murmuring leaves were striving to express. But
"no one knows, or would believe, that such an idea might also take"
"possession of an ill-paid village postmaster in the deep, silent"
mid-day interval of his work.

"The postmaster sighed, and called out 'Ratan.' Ratan was then"
"sprawling beneath the guava-tree, busily engaged in eating unripe"
"guavas. At the voice of her master, she ran up breathlessly, saying:"
"'Were you calling me, Dada?'[40] 'I was thinking,' said the"
"postmaster, 'of teaching you to read,' and then for the rest of"
the afternoon he taught her the alphabet.

  [40] Dada = elder brother.

"Thus, in a very short time, Ratan had got as far as the double"
consonants.

"It seemed as though the showers of the season would never end. Canals,"
"ditches, and hollows were all overflowing with water. Day and night"
"the patter of rain was heard, and the croaking of frogs. The village"
"roads became impassable, and marketing had to be done in punts."

"One heavily clouded morning, the postmaster's little pupil had been"
"long waiting outside the door for her call, but, not hearing it as"
"usual, she took up her dog-eared book, and slowly entered the room."
"She found her master stretched out on his pallet, and, thinking he"
"was resting, she was about to retire on tip-toe, when she suddenly"
heard her name--'Ratan!' She turned at once and asked: 'Were you
"sleeping, Dada?' The postmaster in a plaintive voice said: 'I am not"
well. Feel my head; is it very hot?'

"In the loneliness of his exile, and in the gloom of the rains, his"
ailing body needed a little tender nursing. He longed to remember
"the touch on the forehead of soft hands with tinkling bracelets,"
"to imagine the presence of loving womanhood, the nearness of mother"
and sister. And the exile was not disappointed. Ratan ceased to be a
"little girl. She at once stepped into the post of mother, called in the"
"village doctor, gave the patient his pills at the proper intervals,"
"sat up all night by his pillow, cooked his gruel for him, and every"
"now and then asked: 'Are you feeling a little better, Dada?'"

"It was some time before the postmaster, with weakened body, was able to"
"leave his sick-bed. 'No more of this,' said he with decision. 'I"
must get a transfer.' He at once wrote off to Calcutta an application
"for a transfer, on the ground of the unhealthiness of the place."

"Relieved from her duties as nurse, Ratan again took up her old place"
outside the door. But she no longer heard the same old call. She would
sometimes peep inside furtively to find the postmaster sitting on
"his chair, or stretched on his pallet, and staring absent-mindedly"
"into the air. While Ratan was awaiting her call, the postmaster was"
awaiting a reply to his application. The girl read her old lessons over
"and over again--her great fear was lest, when the call came, she might"
"be found wanting in the double consonants. At last, after a week, the"
call did come one evening. With an overflowing heart Ratan rushed
"into the room with her--'Were you calling me, Dada?'"

"The postmaster said: 'I am going away to-morrow, Ratan.'"

"'Where are you going, Dada?'"

'I am going home.'

'When will you come back?'

'I am not coming back.'

"Ratan asked no other question. The postmaster, of his own accord, went"
"on to tell her that his application for a transfer had been rejected,"
"so he had resigned his post, and was going home."

For a long time neither of them spoke another word. The lamp went
"on dimly burning, and from a leak in one corner of the thatch water"
dripped steadily into an earthen vessel on the floor beneath it.

"After a while Ratan rose, and went off to the kitchen to prepare the"
meal; but she was not so quick about it as on other days. Many new
things to think of had entered her little brain. When the postmaster
"had finished his supper, the girl suddenly asked him: 'Dada, will"
you take me to your home?'

The postmaster laughed. 'What an idea!' said he; but he did not think
it necessary to explain to the girl wherein lay the absurdity.

"That whole night, in her waking and in her dreams, the postmaster's"
laughing reply haunted her--'What an idea!'

"On getting up in the morning, the postmaster found his bath ready. He"
had stuck to his Calcutta habit of bathing in water drawn and kept
"in pitchers, instead of taking a plunge in the river as was the custom"
"of the village. For some reason or other, the girl could not ask"
"him about the time of his departure, so she had fetched the water"
"from the river long before sunrise, that it should be ready as early"
as he might want it. After the bath came a call for Ratan. She entered
"noiselessly, and looked silently into her master's face for orders."
"The master said: 'You need not be anxious about my going away, Ratan;"
I shall tell my successor to look after you.' These words were kindly
"meant, no doubt: but inscrutable are the ways of a woman's heart!"

"Ratan had borne many a scolding from her master without complaint, but"
"these kind words she could not bear. She burst out weeping, and said:"
"'No, no, you need not tell anybody anything at all about me; I don't"
want to stay on here.'

The postmaster was dumbfounded. He had never seen Ratan like this
before.

"The new incumbent duly arrived, and the postmaster, having given over"
"charge, prepared to depart. Just before starting he called Ratan,"
and said: 'Here is something for you; I hope it will keep you for
some little time.' He brought out from his pocket the whole of his
"month's salary, retaining only a trifle for his travelling expenses."
"Then Ratan fell at his feet and cried: 'Oh, Dada, I pray you, don't"
"give me anything, don't in any way trouble about me,' and then she"
ran away out of sight.

"The postmaster heaved a sigh, took up his carpet bag, put his"
"umbrella over his shoulder, and, accompanied by a man carrying his"
"many-coloured tin trunk, he slowly made for the boat."

"When he got in and the boat was under way, and the rain-swollen river,"
"like a stream of tears welling up from the earth, swirled and sobbed at"
"her bows, then he felt a sort of pain at heart; the grief-stricken"
face of a village girl seemed to represent for him the great unspoken
pervading grief of Mother Earth herself. At one time he had an impulse
"to go back, and bring away along with him that lonesome waif, forsaken"
"of the world. But the wind had just filled the sails, the boat had"
"got well into the middle of the turbulent current, and already the"
"village was left behind, and its outlying burning-ground came in sight."

"So the traveller, borne on the breast of the swift-flowing river,"
consoled himself with philosophical reflections on the numberless
"meetings and partings going on in the world--on death, the great"
"parting, from which none returns."

But Ratan had no philosophy. She was wandering about the post office
in a flood of tears. It may be that she had still a lurking hope in
"some corner of her heart that her Dada would return, and that is why"
she could not tear herself away. Alas for the foolish human heart!




THE RIVER STAIRS


"If you wish to hear of days gone by, sit on this step of mine, and lend"
your ears to the murmur of the rippling water.

The month of  Ashwin  (September) was about to begin. The river was in
full flood. Only four of my steps peeped above the surface. The water
"had crept up to the low-lying parts of the bank, where the  kachu "
plant grew dense beneath the branches of the mango grove. At that
"bend of the river, three old brick-heaps towered above the water around"
"them. The fishing-boats, moored to the trunks of the  bbla  trees on"
"the bank, rocked on the heaving flow-tide at dawn. The path of tall"
grasses on the sandbank had caught the newly risen sun; they had just
"begun to flower, and were not yet in full bloom."

The little boats puffed out their tiny sails on the sunlit river. The
Brahmin priest had come to bathe with his ritual vessels. The women
arrived in twos and threes to draw water. I knew this was the time of
Kusum's coming to the bathing-stairs.

But that morning I missed her. Bhuban and Swarno mourned at the
 ght .[41] They said that their friend had been led away to her
"husband's house, which was a place far away from the river, with"
"strange people, strange houses, and strange roads."

  [41] Bathing-place.

In time she almost faded out of my mind. A year passed. The women at
the  ght  now rarely talked of Kusum. But one evening I was startled
"by the touch of the long familiar feet. Ah, yes, but those feet were"
"now without anklets, they had lost their old music."

Kusum had become a widow. They said that her husband had worked in
"some far-off place, and that she had met him only once or twice. A"
"letter brought her the news of his death. A widow at eight years old,"
"she had rubbed out the wife's red mark from her forehead, stripped"
"off her bangles, and come back to her old home by the Ganges. But she"
"found few of her old playmates there. Of them, Bhuban, Swarno, and"
"Amala were married, and gone away; only Sarat remained, and she too,"
"they said, would be wed in December next."

"As the Ganges rapidly grows to fulness with the coming of the rains,"
even so did Kusum day by day grow to the fulness of beauty and youth.
"But her dull-coloured robe, her pensive face, and quiet manners drew"
"a veil over her youth, and hid it from men's eyes as in a mist. Ten"
"years slipped away, and none seemed to have noticed that Kusum had"
grown up.

"One morning such as this, at the end of a far-off September, a tall,"
"young, fair-skinned Sanyasi, coming I know not whence, took shelter"
"in the Shiva temple, in front of me. His arrival was noised abroad in"
"the village. The women left their pitchers behind, and crowded into"
the temple to bow to the holy man.

The crowd increased day by day. The Sanyasi's fame rapidly spread among
"the womenkind. One day he would recite the  Bhgbat , another day he"
"would expound the  Gita , or hold forth upon a holy book in the temple."
"Some sought him for counsel, some for spells, some for medicines."

"So months passed away. In April, at the time of the solar eclipse,"
vast crowds came here to bathe in the Ganges. A fair was held under
"the  bbla  tree. Many of the pilgrims went to visit the Sanyasi, and"
among them were a party of women from the village where Kusum had been
married.

"It was morning. The Sanyasi was counting his beads on my steps, when"
"all of a sudden one of the women pilgrims nudged another, and said:"
'Why! He is our Kusum's husband!' Another parted her veil a little
in the middle with two fingers and cried out: 'Oh dear me! So it is!
He is the younger son of the Chattergu family of our village!' Said a
"third, who made little parade of her veil: 'Ah! he has got exactly"
"the same brow, nose, and eyes!' Yet another woman, without turning"
"to the Sanyasi, stirred the water with her pitcher, and sighed:"
'Alas! That young man is no more; he will not come back. Bad luck
to Kusum!'

"But, objected one, 'He had not such a big beard'; and another,"
'He was not so thin'; or 'He was most probably not so tall.' That
"settled the question for the time, and the matter spread no further."

"One evening, as the full moon arose, Kusum came and sat upon my last"
"step above the water, and cast her shadow upon me."

There was no other at the  ght  just then. The crickets were
chirping about me. The din of brass gongs and bells had ceased in
"the temple--the last wave of sound grew fainter and fainter, until it"
merged like the shade of a sound in the dim groves of the farther
bank. On the dark water of the Ganges lay a line of glistening
"moonlight. On the bank above, in bush and hedge, under the porch of"
"the temple, in the base of ruined houses, by the side of the tank,"
"in the palm grove, gathered shadows of fantastic shape. The bats"
swung from the  chhatim  boughs. Near the houses the loud clamour
of the jackals rose and sank into silence.

Slowly the Sanyasi came out of the temple. Descending a few steps of
"the  ght  he saw a woman sitting alone, and was about to go back,"
"when suddenly Kusum raised her head, and looked behind her. The veil"
"slipped away from her. The moonlight fell upon her face, as she looked"
up.

"The owl flew away hooting over their heads. Starting at the sound,"
Kusum came to herself and put the veil back on her head. Then she bowed
low at the Sanyasi's feet.

He gave her blessing and asked: 'Who are you?'

She replied: 'I am called Kusum.'

No other word was spoken that night. Kusum went slowly back to her
house which was hard by. But the Sanyasi remained sitting on my steps
for long hours that night. At last when the moon passed from the east
"to the west, and the Sanyasi's shadow, shifting from behind, fell in"
"front of him, he rose up and entered the temple."

Henceforth I saw Kusum come daily to bow at his feet. When he expounded
"the holy books, she stood in a corner listening to him. After finishing"
"his morning service, he used to call her to himself and speak on"
"religion. She could not have understood it all; but, listening"
"attentively in silence, she tried to understand it. As he directed"
"her, so she acted implicitly. She daily served at the temple--ever"
"alert in the god's worship--gathering flowers for the  puja , and"
drawing water from the Ganges to wash the temple floor.

The winter was drawing to its close. We had cold winds. But now and
then in the evening the warm spring breeze would blow unexpectedly from
"the south; the sky would lose its chilly aspect; pipes would sound,"
and music be heard in the village after a long silence. The boatmen
"would set their boats drifting down the current, stop rowing, and begin"
to sing the songs of Krishna. This was the season.

Just then I began to miss Kusum. For some time she had given up
"visiting the temple, the  ght , or the Sanyasi."

"What happened next I do not know, but after a while the two met"
together on my steps one evening.

"With downcast looks, Kusum asked: 'Master, did you send for me?'"

"'Yes, why do I not see you? Why have you grown neglectful of late in"
serving the gods?'

She kept silent.

'Tell me your thoughts without reserve.'

"Half averting her face, she replied: 'I am a sinner, Master, and hence"
I have failed in the worship.'

"The Sanyasi said: 'Kusum, I know there is unrest in your heart.'"

"She gave a slight start, and, drawing the end of her sri over her"
"face, she sat down on the step at the Sanyasi's feet, and wept."

"He moved a little away, and said: 'Tell me what you have in your"
"heart, and I shall show you the way to peace.'"

"She replied in a tone of unshaken faith, stopping now and then for"
"words: 'If you bid me, I must speak out. But, then, I cannot explain"
"it clearly. You, Master, must have guessed it all. I adored one as a"
"god, I worshipped him, and the bliss of that devotion filled my heart"
to fulness. But one night I dreamt that the lord of my heart was
"sitting in a garden somewhere, clasping my right hand in his left,"
and whispering to me of love. The whole scene did not appear to me at
"all strange. The dream vanished, but its hold on me remained. Next day"
when I beheld him he appeared in another light than before. That
dream-picture continued to haunt my mind. I fled far from him in
"fear, and the picture clung to me. Thenceforth my heart has known"
"no peace,--all has grown dark within me!'"

"While she was wiping her tears and telling this tale, I felt that the"
Sanyasi was firmly pressing my stone surface with his right foot.

"Her speech done, the Sanyasi said:"

'You must tell me whom you saw in your dream.'

"With folded hands, she entreated: 'I cannot.'"

He insisted: 'You must tell me who he was.'

Wringing her hands she asked: 'Must I tell it?'

"He replied: 'Yes, you must.'"

"Then crying, 'You are he, Master!' she fell on her face on my stony"
"bosom, and sobbed."

"When she came to herself, and sat up, the Sanyasi said slowly: 'I am"
leaving this place to-night that you may not see me again. Know that
"I am a Sanyasi, not belonging to this world.  You  must forget me.'"

"Kusum replied in a low voice: 'It will be so, Master.'"

The Sanyasi said: 'I take my leave.'

"Without a word more Kusum bowed to him, and placed the dust of his feet"
on her head. He left the place.

The moon set; the night grew dark. I heard a splash in the water. The
"wind raved in the darkness, as if it wanted to blow out all the stars"
of the sky.




THE CASTAWAY


Towards evening the storm was at its height. From the terrific downpour
"of rain, the crash of thunder, and the repeated flashes of lightning,"
you might think that a battle of the gods and demons was raging in
the skies. Black clouds waved like the Flags of Doom. The Ganges was
"lashed into a fury, and the trees of the gardens on either bank swayed"
from side to side with sighs and groans.

"In a closed room of one of the riverside houses at Chandernagore, a"
"husband and his wife were seated on a bed spread on the floor, intently"
discussing. An earthen lamp burned beside them.

"The husband, Sharat, was saying: 'I wish you would stay on a few days"
more; you would then be able to return home quite strong again.'

"The wife, Kiran, was saying: 'I have quite recovered already. It will"
"not, cannot possibly, do me any harm to go home now.'"

Every married person will at once understand that the conversation
was not quite so brief as I have reported it. The matter was not
"difficult, but the arguments for and against did not advance it"
"towards a solution. Like a rudderless boat, the discussion kept"
turning round and round the same point; and at last it threatened to
be overwhelmed in a flood of tears.

Sharat said: 'The doctor thinks you should stop here a few days
longer.'

Kiran replied: 'Your doctor knows everything!'

"'Well,' said Sharat, 'you know that just now all sorts of illness"
are abroad. You would do well to stop here a month or two more.'

'And at this moment I suppose every one in this place is perfectly
well!'

What had happened was this: Kiran was a universal favourite with her
"family and neighbours, so that, when she fell seriously ill, they"
were all anxious. The village wiseacres thought it shameless for her
husband to make so much fuss about a mere wife and even to suggest a
"change of air, and asked if Sharat supposed that no woman had ever"
"been ill before, or whether he had found out that the folk of the"
place to which he meant to take her were immortal. Did he imagine
that the writ of Fate did not run there? But Sharat and his mother
"turned a deaf ear to them, thinking that the little life of their"
darling was of greater importance than the united wisdom of a village.
People are wont to reason thus when danger threatens their loved ones.
"So Sharat went to Chandernagore, and Kiran recovered, though she was"
still very weak. There was a pinched look on her face which filled the
"beholder with pity, and made his heart tremble, as he thought how"
narrowly she had escaped death.

Kiran was fond of society and amusement; the loneliness of her
"riverside villa did not suit her at all. There was nothing to do,"
"there were no interesting neighbours, and she hated to be busy all"
day with medicine and dieting. There was no fun in measuring doses
and making fomentations. Such was the subject discussed in their
closed room on this stormy evening.

"So long as Kiran deigned to argue, there was a chance of a fair fight."
"When she ceased to reply, and with a toss of her head disconsolately"
"looked the other way, the poor man was disarmed. He was on the point"
of surrendering unconditionally when a servant shouted a message
through the shut door.

"Sharat got up, and, opening the door, learnt that a boat had been upset"
"in the storm, and that one of the occupants, a young Brahmin boy, had"
succeeded in swimming ashore in their garden.

"Kiran was at once her own sweet self, and set to work to get out some"
"dry clothes for the boy. She then warmed a cup of milk, and invited him"
to her room.

"The boy had long curly hair, big expressive eyes, and no sign yet of"
"hair on the face. Kiran, after getting him to drink some milk, asked"
him all about himself.

"He told her that his name was Nilkanta, and that he belonged to a"
theatrical troupe. They were coming to play in a neighbouring villa
when the boat had suddenly foundered in the storm. He had no idea
"what had become of his companions. He was a good swimmer, and had"
just managed to reach the shore.

The boy stayed with them. His narrow escape from a terrible death
made Kiran take a warm interest in him. Sharat thought the boy's
"appearance at this moment rather a good thing, as his wife would now"
"have something to amuse her, and might be persuaded to stay on for some"
"time longer. Her mother-in-law, too, was pleased at the prospect of"
profiting their Brahmin guest by her kindness. And Nilkanta himself was
delighted at his double escape from his master and from the other
"world, as well as at finding a home in this wealthy family."

"But in a short while Sharat and his mother changed their opinion, and"
longed for his departure. The boy found a secret pleasure in smoking
Sharat's hookas; he would calmly go off in pouring rain with Sharat's
"best silk umbrella for a stroll through the village, and make friends"
"with all whom he met. Moreover, he had got hold of a mongrel village"
"dog which he petted so recklessly that it came indoors with muddy paws,"
and left tokens of its visit on Sharat's spotless bed. Then he gathered
"about him a devoted band of boys of all sorts and sizes, and the result"
was that not a solitary mango in the neighbourhood had a chance of
ripening that season.

There is no doubt that Kiran had a hand in spoiling the boy. Sharat
"often warned her about it, but she would not listen to him. She made a"
"dandy of him with Sharat's cast-off clothes, and gave him new ones"
"too. And because she felt drawn towards him, and also had a curiosity"
"to know more about him, she was constantly calling him to her own"
room. After her bath and mid-day meal Kiran would be seated on the
bedstead with her betel-leaf box by her side; and while her maid
"combed and dried her hair, Nilkanta would stand in front and recite"
"pieces out of his repertory with appropriate gesture and song, his"
elf-locks waving wildly. Thus the long afternoon hours passed merrily
away. Kiran would often try to persuade Sharat to sit with her as
"one of the audience, but Sharat, who had taken a cordial dislike to"
"the boy, refused, nor could Nilkanta do his part half so well when"
Sharat was there. His mother would sometimes be lured by the hope
of hearing sacred names in the recitation; but love of her mid-day
"sleep speedily overcame devotion, and she lay lapped in dreams."

"The boy often got his ears boxed and pulled by Sharat, but as this"
"was nothing to what he had been used to as a member of the troupe,"
he did not mind it in the least. In his short experience of the world
"he had come to the conclusion that, as the earth consisted of land and"
"water, so human life was made up of eatings and beatings, and that"
the beatings largely predominated.

It was hard to tell Nilkanta's age. If it was about fourteen or
"fifteen, then his face was too old for his years; if seventeen or"
"eighteen, then it was too young. He was either a man too early or"
"a boy too late. The fact was that, joining the theatrical band when"
"very young, he had played the parts of Radhika, Damaynti, Sita, and"
Bidya's Companion. A thoughtful Providence so arranged things that
"he grew to the exact stature that his manager required, and then"
"growth ceased. Since every one saw how small he was, and he himself"
"felt small, he did not receive due respect for his years. These"
"causes, natural and artificial, combined to make him sometimes seem"
"immature for seventeen years, and at other times a lad of fourteen"
but far too knowing for seventeen. And as no sign of hair appeared on
"his face, the confusion became greater. Either because he smoked"
"or because he used language beyond his years, his lips puckered into"
lines that showed him to be old and hard; but innocence and youth
"shone in his large eyes. I fancy that his heart remained young, but"
the hot glare of publicity had been a forcing-house that ripened
untimely his outward aspect.

"In the quiet shelter of Sharat's house and garden at Chandernagore,"
Nature had leisure to work her way unimpeded. He had lingered in a kind
"of unnatural youth, but now he silently and swiftly overpassed that"
stage. His seventeen or eighteen years came to adequate revelation. No
"one observed the change, and its first sign was this, that when Kiran"
"treated him like a boy, he felt ashamed. When the gay Kiran one"
"day proposed that he should play the part of lady's companion, the"
"idea of woman's dress hurt him, though he could not say why. So now,"
"when she called for him to act over again his old characters, he"
disappeared. It never occurred to him that he was even now not much
more than a lad-of-all-work in a strolling company. He even made up
"his mind to pick up a little education from Sharat's factor. But,"
"because Nilkanta was the pet of his master's wife, the factor could"
"not endure the sight of him. Also, his restless training made it"
"impossible for him to keep his mind long engaged; presently, the"
alphabet did a misty dance before his eyes. He would sit long enough
"with an open book on his lap, leaning against a  champak  bush"
"beside the Ganges. The waves sighed below, boats floated past,"
birds flitted and twittered restlessly above. What thoughts passed
"through his mind as he looked down on that book he alone knew, if"
"indeed he did know. He never advanced from one word to another, but"
the glorious thought that he was actually reading a book filled his
"soul with exultation. Whenever a boat went by, he lifted his book, and"
"pretended to be reading hard, shouting at the top of his voice. But"
his energy dropped as soon as the audience was gone.

"Formerly he sang his songs automatically, but now their tunes stirred"
"in his mind. Their words were of little import, and full of trifling"
alliteration. Even the little meaning they had was beyond his
comprehension; yet when he sang--

    Twice-born[42] bird! ah! wherefore stirred
      To wrong our royal lady?
"    Goose, ah! say why wilt thou slay"
      Her in forest shady?[43]

"then he felt as if transported to another world, and to far other folk."
"This familiar earth and his own poor life became music, and he was"
transformed. That tale of goose and king's daughter flung upon the
mirror of his mind a picture of surpassing beauty. It is impossible to
"say what he imagined he himself was, but the destitute little slave"
of the theatrical troupe faded from his memory.

"  [42] Once in the egg, and again once out of the egg."

  [43] See note on Damaynti.

"When with evening the child of want lies down, dirty and hungry, in"
"his squalid home, and hears of prince and princess and fabled gold,"
"then in the dark hovel with its dim flickering candle, his mind springs"
"free from her bonds of poverty and misery, and walks in fresh beauty"
"and glowing raiment, strong beyond all fear of hindrance, through that"
fairy realm where all is possible.

"Even so, this drudge of wandering players fashioned himself and"
"his world anew, as he moved in spirit amid his songs. The lapping"
"water, rustling leaves, and calling birds; the goddess who had given"
"shelter to him, the helpless, the Godforsaken; her gracious, lovely"
"face, her exquisite arms with their shining bangles, her rosy feet"
as soft as flower-petals; all these by some magic became one with
"the music of his song. When the singing ended, the mirage faded, and"
"Nilkanta of the stage appeared again, with his wild elf-locks. Fresh"
"from the complaints of his neighbour, the owner of the despoiled"
"mango-orchard, Sharat would come and box his ears, and cuff him. The"
"boy Nilkanta, the misleader of adoring youths, went forth once more,"
to make ever new mischief by land and water and in the branches that
are above the earth.

"Shortly after the advent of Nilkanta, Sharat's younger brother, Satish,"
came to spend his college vacation with them. Kiran was hugely pleased
"at finding a fresh occupation. She and Satish were of the same age,"
and the time passed pleasantly in games and quarrels and makings-up
and laughter and even tears. Suddenly she would clasp him over the
"eyes, from behind, with vermilion-stained hands, she would write"
"'monkey' on his back, and sometimes bolt the door on him from outside"
amidst peals of laughter. Satish in his turn did not take things
"lying down; he would take her keys and rings, he would put pepper"
among her betel; he would tie her to the bed when she was not looking.

"Meanwhile, heaven only knows what possessed poor Nilkanta. He was"
suddenly filled with a bitterness which he must avenge on somebody
"or something. He thrashed his devoted boy-followers for no fault, and"
sent them away crying. He would kick his pet mongrel till it made the
"skies resound with its whinings. When he went out for a walk, he would"
litter his path with twigs and leaves beaten from the roadside shrubs
with his cane.

Kiran liked to see people enjoying good fare. Nilkanta had an immense
"capacity for eating, and never refused a good thing, however often it"
was offered. So Kiran liked to send for him to have his meals in
"her presence, and ply him with delicacies, happy in the bliss of"
seeing this Brahmin boy eat to satiety. After Satish's arrival she
"had much less spare time on her hands, and was seldom present when"
"Nilkanta's meals were served. Before, her absence made no difference"
"to the boy's appetite, and he would not rise till he had drained his"
"cup of milk, and rinsed it thoroughly with water.[44]"

"  [44] A habit which was relic from his days of poverty, when milk was"
  too rare a luxury to allow of even its stains in the cup being wasted.

"But now, if Kiran was not present to ask him to try this and that,"
"he was miserable, and nothing tasted right. He would get up without"
"eating much, and say to the serving-maid in a choking voice: 'I am"
not hungry.' He thought in imagination that the news of his repeated
"refusal, 'I am not hungry,' would reach Kiran; he pictured her"
"concern, and hoped that she would send for him, and press him to eat."
"But nothing of the sort happened. Kiran never knew, and never sent for"
him; and the maid finished whatever he left. He would then put out
"the lamp in his room, and throw himself on his bed in the darkness,"
burying his head in the pillow in a paroxysm of sobs. What was his
"grievance? Against whom? And from whom did he expect redress? At last,"
"when none else came, Mother Sleep soothed with her soft caresses"
the wounded heart of the motherless lad.

Nilkanta came to the unshakable conviction that Satish was poisoning
"Kiran's mind against him. If Kiran was absent-minded, and had not her"
"usual smile, he would jump to the conclusion that some trick of Satish"
"had made her angry with him. He took to praying to the gods, with all"
"the fervour of his hate, to make him at the next rebirth Satish, and"
Satish him. He had an idea that a Brahmin's wrath could never be in
vain; and the more he tried to consume Satish with the fire of his
"curses, the more did his own heart burn within him. And upstairs he"
would hear Satish laughing and joking with his sister-in-law.

Nilkanta never dared openly to show his enmity to Satish. But he
would contrive a hundred petty ways of causing him annoyance. When
"Satish went for a swim in the river, and left his soap on the steps"
"of the bathing-place, on coming back for it he would find that it"
had disappeared. Once he found his favourite striped tunic floating
"past him on the water, and thought it had been blown away by the wind."

"One day Kiran, desiring to entertain Satish, sent for Nilkanta to"
"recite as usual, but he stood there in gloomy silence. Quite surprised,"
Kiran asked him what was the matter. But he remained silent. And when
again pressed by her to repeat some particular favourite piece of
"hers, he answered: 'I don't remember,' and walked away."

At last the time came for their return home. Everybody was busy packing
up. Satish was going with them. But to Nilkanta nobody said a word.
The question whether he was to go or not seemed not to have occurred
to anybody.

"The question, as a matter of fact, had been raised by Kiran, who had"
proposed to take him along with them. But her husband and his mother
and brother had all objected so strenuously that she let the matter
"drop. A couple of days before they were to start, she sent for the boy,"
and with kind words advised him to go back to his own home.

So many days had he felt neglected that this touch of kindness was
too much for him; he burst into tears. Kiran's eyes were also brimming
over. She was filled with remorse at the thought that she had created
"a tie of affection, which could not be permanent."

But Satish was much annoyed at the blubbering of this overgrown boy.
'Why does the fool stand there howling instead of speaking?' said
"he. When Kiran scolded him for an unfeeling creature, he replied:"
"'Sister mine, you do not understand. You are too good and trustful."
"This fellow turns up from the Lord knows where, and is treated like"
a king. Naturally the tiger has no wish to become a mouse again.[45]
And he has evidently discovered that there is nothing like a tear
or two to soften your heart.'

  [45] A reference to a folk-story of a saint who turned a pet mouse
  into a tiger.

Nilkanta hurriedly left the spot. He felt he would like to be a knife
to cut Satish to pieces; a needle to pierce him through and through; a
fire to burn him to ashes. But Satish was not even scarred. It was only
his own heart that bled and bled.

Satish had brought with him from Calcutta a grand inkstand. The inkpot
was set in a mother-of-pearl boat drawn by a German-silver goose
"supporting a penholder. It was a great favourite of his, and he cleaned"
it carefully every day with an old silk handkerchief. Kiran would
"laugh and, tapping the silver bird's beak, would say--"

"    Twice-born bird, ah! wherefore stirred"
      To wrong our royal lady?

and the usual war of words would break out between her and her
brother-in-law.

"The day before they were to start, the inkstand was missing, and could"
"nowhere be found. Kiran smiled, and said: 'Brother-in-law, your goose"
has flown off to look for your Damaynti.'[46]

  [46] To find Satish a wife.

But Satish was in a great rage. He was certain that Nilkanta had stolen
it--for several people said they had seen him prowling about the room
the night before. He had the accused brought before him. Kiran also
"was there. 'You have stolen my inkstand, you thief!' he blurted out."
'Bring it back at once.' Nilkanta had always taken punishment from
"Sharat, deserved or undeserved, with perfect equanimity. But, when"
"he was called a thief in Kiran's presence, his eyes blazed with a"
"fierce anger, his breast swelled, and his throat choked. If Satish had"
"said another word he would have flown at him like a wild cat, and used"
his nails like claws.

"Kiran was greatly distressed at the scene, and taking the boy into"
"another room said in her sweet, kind way: 'Nilu, if you really have"
"taken that inkstand give it to me quietly, and I shall see that no"
one says another word to you about it.' Big tears coursed down the
"boy's cheeks, till at last he hid his face in his hands, and wept"
"bitterly. Kiran came back from the room, and said: 'I am sure Nilkanta"
has not taken the inkstand.' Sharat and Satish were equally positive
that no other than Nilkanta could have done it.

But Kiran said determinedly: 'Never.'

"Sharat wanted to cross-examine the boy, but his wife refused to allow"
it.

Then Satish suggested that his room and box should be searched. And
"Kiran said: 'If you dare do such a thing I will never, never forgive"
"you. You shall not spy on the poor innocent boy.' And as she spoke,"
"her wonderful eyes filled with tears. That settled the matter, and"
effectually prevented any further molestation of Nilkanta!

Kiran's heart overflowed with pity at this attempted outrage on a
"homeless lad. She got two new suits of clothes and a pair of shoes, and"
with these and a banknote in her hand she quietly went into Nilkanta's
room in the evening. She intended to put these parting presents into
his box as a surprise. The box itself had been her gift.

"From her bunch of keys she selected one that fitted, and noiselessly"
opened the box. It was so jumbled up with odds and ends that the new
clothes would not go in. So she thought she had better take everything
"out and pack the box for him. At first knives, tops, kite-flying"
"reels, bamboo twigs, polished shells for peeling green mangoes, bottoms"
of broken tumblers and such like things dear to a boy's heart were
"discovered. Then there came a layer of linen, clean and otherwise."
"And from under the linen there emerged the missing inkstand, goose"
and all!

"Kiran, with flushed face, sat down helplessly with the inkstand in her"
"hand, puzzled and wondering."

"In the meantime, Nilkanta had come into the room from behind without"
"Kiran knowing it. He had seen the whole thing, and thought that Kiran"
"had come like a thief to catch him in his thieving,--and that his deed"
was out. How could he ever hope to convince her that he was not a
"thief, and that only revenge had prompted him to take the inkstand,"
which he meant to throw into the river at the first chance? In a weak
"moment he had put it in his box instead. 'He was not a thief,' his"
"heart cried out, 'not a thief!' Then what was he? What could he say?"
"He had stolen, and yet he was not a thief! He could never explain"
to Kiran how grievously wrong she was in taking him for a thief; how
could he bear the thought that she had tried to spy on him?

"At last Kiran with a deep sigh replaced the inkstand in the box, and,"
"as if she were the thief herself, covered it up with the linen and the"
trinkets as they were before; and at the top she placed the presents
together with the banknote which she had brought for him.

The next day the boy was nowhere to be found. The villagers had not
seen him; the police could discover no trace of him. Said Sharat:
"'Now, as a matter of curiosity, let us have a look at his box.' But"
Kiran was obstinate in her refusal to allow that to be done.

She had the box brought up to her own room; and taking out the inkstand
"alone, threw it into the river."

The whole family went home. In a day the garden became desolate. And
only that starving mongrel of Nilkanta's remained prowling along the
"river-bank, whining and whining as if its heart would break."




SAVED


"Gouri was the beautiful, delicately nurtured child of an old and"
"wealthy family. Her husband, Paresh, had recently by his own efforts"
"improved his straitened circumstances. So long as he was poor, Gouri's"
"parents had kept their daughter at home, unwilling to surrender her"
to privation; so she was no longer young when at last she went to her
husband's house. And Paresh never felt quite that she belonged to
"him. He was an advocate in a small western town, and had no close"
"kinsman with him. All his thought was about his wife, so much so that"
sometimes he would come home before the rising of the Court. At
first Gouri was at a loss to understand why he came back suddenly.
"Sometimes, too, he would dismiss one of the servants without reason;"
none of them ever suited him long. Especially if Gouri desired to
"keep any particular servant because he was useful, that man was"
sure to be got rid of forthwith. The high-spirited Gouri greatly
"resented this, but her resentment only made her husband's behaviour"
still stranger.

"At last when Paresh, unable to contain himself any longer, began in"
"secret to cross-question the maid about her, the whole thing reached"
his wife's ears. She was a woman of few words; but her pride raged
"within like a wounded lioness at these insults, and this mad suspicion"
"swept like a destroyer's sword between them. Paresh, as soon as he saw"
"that his wife understood his motive, felt no more delicacy about"
taxing Gouri to her face; and the more his wife treated it with silent
"contempt, the more did the fire of his jealousy consume him."

"Deprived of wedded happiness, the childless Gouri betook herself to the"
"consolations of religion. She sent for Paramananda Swami, the young"
"preacher of the Prayer-House hard by, and, formally acknowledging him"
"as her spiritual preceptor, asked him to expound the  Gita  to her. All"
the wasted love and affection of her woman's heart was poured out in
reverence at the feet of her Guru.

No one had any doubts about the purity of Paramananda's character.
All worshipped him. And because Paresh did not dare to hint at any
"suspicion against him, his jealousy ate its way into his heart like a"
hidden cancer.

One day some trifling circumstance made the poison overflow. Paresh
"reviled Paramananda to his wife as a hypocrite, and said: 'Can you"
swear that you are not in love with this crane that plays the ascetic?'

"Gouri sprang up like a snake that has been trodden on, and, maddened"
"by his suspicion, said with bitter irony: 'And what if I am?' At"
"this Paresh forthwith went off to the Court-house, and locked the door"
on her.

"In a white heat of passion at this last outrage, Gouri got the door"
"open somehow, and left the house."

Paramananda was poring over the scriptures in his lonely room in
"the silence of noon. All at once, like a flash of lightning out of a"
"cloudless sky, Gouri broke in upon his reading."

'You here?' questioned her Guru in surprise.

"'Rescue me, O my lord Guru,' said she, 'from the insults of my home"
"life, and allow me to dedicate myself to the service of your feet.'"

"With a stern rebuke, Paramananda sent Gouri back home. But I wonder"
whether he ever again took up the snapped thread of his reading.

"Paresh, finding the door open, on his return home, asked: 'Who has"
been here?'

No one!' his wife replied. ' I  have been to the house of my Guru.'

"'Why?' asked Paresh, pale and red by turns."

'Because I wanted to.'

"From that day Paresh had a guard kept over the house, and behaved so"
absurdly that the tale of his jealousy was told all over the town.

The news of the shameful insults that were daily heaped on his disciple
disturbed the religious meditations of Paramananda. He felt he ought to
leave the place at once; at the same time he could not make up his
mind to forsake the tortured woman. Who can say how the poor ascetic
got through those terrible days and nights?

"At last one day the imprisoned Gouri got a letter. 'My child,' it"
"ran, 'it is true that many holy women have left the world to devote"
themselves to God. Should it happen that the trials of this world are
"driving your thoughts away from God, I will with God's help rescue his"
"handmaid for the holy service of his feet. If you desire, you may meet"
me by the tank in your garden at two o'clock to-morrow afternoon.'

Gouri hid the letter in the loops of her hair. At noon next day when
she was undoing her hair before her bath she found that the letter
was not there. Could it have fallen on to the bed and got into her
"husband's hands, she wondered. At first, she felt a kind of fierce"
pleasure in thinking that it would enrage him; and then she could not
"bear to think that this letter, worn as a halo of deliverance on her"
"head, might be defiled by the touch of insolent hands."

With swift steps she hurried to her husband's room. He lay groaning on
"the floor, with eyes rolled back and foaming mouth. She detached the"
"letter from his clenched fist, and sent quickly for a doctor."

The doctor said it was a case of apoplexy. The patient had died before
his arrival.

"That very day, as it happened, Paresh had an important appointment away"
"from home. Paramananda had found this out, and accordingly had made"
his appointment with Gouri. To such a depth had he fallen!

When the widowed Gouri caught sight from the window of her Guru
"stealing like a thief to the side of the pool, she lowered her eyes"
as at a lightning flash. And in that flash she saw clearly what a fall
his had been.

The Guru called: 'Gouri.'

MY FAIR NEIGHBOUR


My feelings towards the young widow who lived in the next house to
"mine were feelings of worship; at least, that is what I told to my"
"friends and myself. Even my nearest intimate, Nabin, knew nothing of"
the real state of my mind. And I had a sort of pride that I could keep
my passion pure by thus concealing it in the inmost recesses of my
"heart. She was like a dew-drenched  sephali -blossom, untimely fallen"
"to earth. Too radiant and holy for the flower-decked marriage-bed,"
she had been dedicated to Heaven.

"But passion is like the mountain stream, and refuses to be enclosed in"
the place of its birth; it must seek an outlet. That is why I tried to
give expression to my emotions in poems; but my unwilling pen refused
to desecrate the object of my worship.

It happened curiously that just at this time my friend Nabin was
afflicted with a madness of verse. It came upon him like an earthquake.
"It was the poor fellow's first attack, and he was equally unprepared"
"for rhyme and rhythm. Nevertheless he could not refrain, for he"
"succumbed to the fascination, as a widower to his second wife."

"So Nabin sought help from me. The subject of his poems was the old, old"
"one, which is ever new: his poems were all addressed to the beloved"
"one. I slapped his back in jest, and asked him: 'Well, old chap, who"
is she?'

"Nabin laughed, as he replied: 'That I have not yet discovered!'"

I confess that I found considerable comfort in bringing help to my
"friend. Like a hen brooding on a duck's egg, I lavished all the warmth"
of my pent-up passion on Nabin's effusions. So vigorously did I revise
"and improve his crude productions, that the larger part of each poem"
became my own.

"Then Nabin would say in surprise: 'That is just what I wanted to say,"
but could not. How on earth do you manage to get hold of all these
fine sentiments?'

"Poet-like, I would reply: 'They come from my imagination; for, as you"
"know, truth is silent, and it is imagination only which waxes"
eloquent. Reality represses the flow of feeling like a rock;
imagination cuts out a path for itself.'

"And the poor puzzled Nabin would say: 'Y-e-s, I see, yes, of course';"
"and then after some thought would murmur again: 'Yes, yes, you are"
right!'

"As I have already said, in my own love there was a feeling of"
reverential delicacy which prevented me from putting it into words.
"But with Nabin as a screen, there was nothing to hinder the flow"
of my pen; and a true warmth of feeling gushed out into these
vicarious poems.

Nabin in his lucid moments would say: 'But these are yours! Let me
publish them over your name.'

"'Nonsense!' I would reply. 'They are yours, my dear fellow; I have"
only added a touch or two here and there.'

And Nabin gradually came to believe it.

"I will not deny that, with a feeling akin to that of the astronomer"
"gazing into the starry heavens, I did sometimes turn my eyes towards"
the window of the house next door. It is also true that now and again
my furtive glances would be rewarded with a vision. And the least
glimpse of the pure light of that countenance would at once still
and clarify all that was turbulent and unworthy in my emotions.

But one day I was startled. Could I believe my eyes? It was a hot
summer afternoon. One of the fierce and fitful nor'-westers was
threatening. Black clouds were massed in the north-west corner of the
sky; and against the strange and fearful light of that background
"my fair neighbour stood, gazing out into empty space. And what a"
world of forlorn longing did I discover in the far-away look of
"those lustrous black eyes! Was there then, perchance, still some"
living volcano within the serene radiance of that moon of mine?
"Alas! that look of limitless yearning, which was winging its way"
"through the clouds like an eager bird, surely sought--not heaven--but"
the nest of some human heart!

At the sight of the unutterable passion of that look I could hardly
contain myself. I was no longer satisfied with correcting crude poems.
My whole being longed to express itself in some worthy action. At last
I thought I would devote myself to making widow-remarriage popular in
"my country. I was prepared not only to speak and write on the subject,"
but also to spend money on its cause.

"Nabin began to argue with me. 'Permanent widowhood,' said he, 'has"
in it a sense of immense purity and peace; a calm beauty like that of
the silent places of the dead shimmering in the wan light of the
eleventh moon.[47] Would not the mere possibility of remarriage destroy
its divine beauty?'

  [47] The eleventh day of the moon is a day of fasting and penance.

Now this sort of sentimentality always makes me furious. In time of
"famine, if a well-fed man speaks scornfully of food, and advises a"
starving man at point of death to glut his hunger on the fragrance
"of flowers and the song of birds, what are we to think of him? I"
"said with some heat: 'Look here, Nabin, to the artist a ruin may be a"
beautiful object; but houses are built not only for the contemplation
"of artists, but that people may live therein; so they have to be"
kept in repair in spite of artistic susceptibilities. It is all very
"well for you to idealise widowhood from your safe distance, but you"
should remember that within widowhood there is a sensitive human
"heart, throbbing with pain and desire.'"

I had an impression that the conversion of Nabin would be a difficult
"matter, so perhaps I was more impassioned than I need have been. I was"
somewhat surprised to find at the conclusion of my little speech that
Nabin after a single thoughtful sigh completely agreed with me. The
even more convincing peroration which I felt I might have delivered
was not needed!

"After about a week Nabin came to me, and said that if I would help him"
he was prepared to lead the way by marrying a widow himself.

"I was overjoyed. I embraced him effusively, and promised him any money"
that might be required for the purpose. Then Nabin told me his story.

I learned that Nabin's loved one was not an imaginary being. It
"appeared that Nabin, too, had for some time adored a widow from a"
"distance, but had not spoken of his feelings to any living soul."
"Then the magazines in which Nabin's poems, or rather  my  poems,"
used to appear had reached the fair one's hands; and the poems had
not been ineffective.

"Not that Nabin had deliberately intended, as he was careful to explain,"
"to conduct love-making in that way. In fact, said he, he had no"
"idea that the widow knew how to read. He used to post the magazine,"
"without disclosing the sender's name, addressed to the widow's"
"brother. It was only a sort of fancy of his, a concession to his"
hopeless passion. It was flinging garlands before a deity; it is not
"the worshipper's affair whether the god knows or not, whether he"
accepts or ignores the offering.

And Nabin particularly wanted me to understand that he had no
definite end in view when on diverse pretexts he sought and made the
acquaintance of the widow's brother. Any near relation of the loved
one needs must have a special interest for the lover.

Then followed a long story about how an illness of the brother at last
brought them together. The presence of the poet himself naturally led
to much discussion of the poems; nor was the discussion necessarily
restricted to the subject out of which it arose.

"After his recent defeat in argument at my hands, Nabin had mustered"
up courage to propose marriage to the widow. At first he could not
"gain her consent. But when he had made full use of my eloquent words,"
"supplemented by a tear or two of his own, the fair one capitulated"
unconditionally. Some money was now wanted by her guardian to make
arrangements.

"'Take it at once,' said I."

"'But,' Nabin went on, 'you know it will be some months before I can"
appease my father sufficiently for him to continue my allowance. How
are we to live in the meantime?' I wrote out the necessary cheque
"without a word, and then I said: 'Now tell me who she is. You need"
"not look on me as a possible rival, for I swear I will not write poems"
"to her; and even if I do I will not send them to her brother, but to"
you!'

"'Don't be absurd,' said Nabin; 'I have not kept back her name"
"because I feared your rivalry! The fact is, she was very much perturbed"
"at taking this unusual step, and had asked me not to talk about the"
"matter to my friends. But it no longer matters, now that everything"
"has been satisfactorily settled. She lives at No. 19, the house next to"
yours.'

If my heart had been an iron boiler it would have burst. 'So she has
no objection to remarriage?' I simply asked.

"'Not at the present moment,' replied Nabin with a smile."

'And was it the poems alone which wrought the magic change?'

"'Well, my poems were not so bad, you know,' said Nabin, 'were they?'"

I swore mentally.

But at whom was I to swear? At him? At myself? At Providence? All the
"same, I swore."
