CHAPTER I


O ye who tread the Narrow Way
"By Tophet-flare to Judgment Day,"
Be gentle when â the heathenâ  pray
To Buddha at Kamakura!

"He sat, in defiance of municipal orders, astride the gun Zam Zammah on"
"her brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gherâ the Wonder House, as the"
"natives call the Lahore Museum. Who hold Zam-Zammah, that"
"â fire-breathing dragon, hold the Punjab, for the great green-bronze"
piece is always first of the conquerorâ s loot.

There was some justification for Kimâ he had kicked Lala Dinanathâ s boy
off the trunnionsâ since the English held the Punjab and Kim was
English. Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the
"vernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain"
sing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the
small boys of the bazar; Kim was whiteâ a poor white of the very
"poorest. The half-caste woman who looked after him (she smoked opium,"
and pretended to keep a second-hand furniture shop by the square where
the cheap cabs wait) told the missionaries that she was Kimâ s motherâ s
sister; but his mother had been nursemaid in a Colonelâ s family and had
"married Kimball Oâ Hara, a young colour-sergeant of the Mavericks, an"
"Irish regiment. He afterwards took a post on the Sind, Punjab, and"
"Delhi Railway, and his Regiment went home without him. The wife died of"
"cholera in Ferozepore, and Oâ Hara fell to drink and loafing up and down"
the line with the keen-eyed three-year-old baby. Societies and
"chaplains, anxious for the child, tried to catch him, but Oâ Hara"
"drifted away, till he came across the woman who took opium and learned"
"the taste from her, and died as poor whites die in India. His estate at"
death consisted of three papersâ one he called his â  ne varietur â 
"because those words were written below his signature thereon, and"
another his â clearance-certificateâ . The third was Kimâ s
"birth-certificate. Those things, he was used to say, in his glorious"
"opium-hours, would yet make little Kimball a man. On no account was Kim"
"to part with them, for they belonged to a great piece of magicâ such"
"magic as men practised over yonder behind the Museum, in the big"
"blue-and-white Jadoo-Gherâ the Magic House, as we name the Masonic"
"Lodge. It would, he said, all come right some day, and Kimâ s horn would"
be exalted between pillarsâ monstrous pillarsâ of beauty and strength.
"The Colonel himself, riding on a horse, at the head of the finest"
"Regiment in the world, would attend to Kimâ little Kim that should have"
"been better off than his father. Nine hundred first-class devils, whose"
"God was a Red Bull on a green field, would attend to Kim, if they had"
not forgotten Oâ Haraâ poor Oâ Hara that was gang-foreman on the
Ferozepore line. Then he would weep bitterly in the broken rush chair
on the veranda. So it came about after his death that the woman sewed
"parchment, paper, and birth-certificate into a leather amulet-case"
which she strung round Kimâ s neck.

"â And some day,â  she said, confusedly remembering Oâ Haraâ s prophecies,"
"â there will come for you a great Red Bull on a green field, and the"
"Colonel riding on his tall horse, yes, andâ  dropping into Englishâ â nine"
hundred devils.â 

"â Ah,â  said Kim, â I shall remember. A Red Bull and a Colonel on a horse"
"will come, but first, my father said, will come the two men making"
ready the ground for these matters. That is how my father said they
always did; and it is always so when men work magic.â 

"If the woman had sent Kim up to the local Jadoo-Gher with those papers,"
"he would, of course, have been taken over by the Provincial Lodge, and"
sent to the Masonic Orphanage in the Hills; but what she had heard of
"magic she distrusted. Kim, too, held views of his own. As he reached"
"the years of indiscretion, he learned to avoid missionaries and white"
"men of serious aspect who asked who he was, and what he did. For Kim"
"did nothing with an immense success. True, he knew the wonderful walled"
city of Lahore from the Delhi Gate to the outer Fort Ditch; was hand in
glove with men who led lives stranger than anything Haroun al Raschid
"dreamed of; and he lived in a life wild as that of the Arabian Nights,"
but missionaries and secretaries of charitable societies could not see
the beauty of it. His nickname through the wards was â Little Friend of
"all the Worldâ ; and very often, being lithe and inconspicuous, he"
executed commissions by night on the crowded housetops for sleek and
"shiny young men of fashion. It was intrigue,â of course he knew that"
"much, as he had known all evil since he could speak,â but what he loved"
was the game for its own sakeâ the stealthy prowl through the dark
"gullies and lanes, the crawl up a waterpipe, the sights and sounds of"
"the womenâ s world on the flat roofs, and the headlong flight from"
housetop to housetop under cover of the hot dark. Then there were holy
"men, ash-smeared  faquirs  by their brick shrines under the trees at"
"the riverside, with whom he was quite familiarâ greeting them as they"
"returned from begging-tours, and, when no one was by, eating from the"
same dish. The woman who looked after him insisted with tears that he
"should wear European clothesâ trousers, a shirt and a battered hat. Kim"
found it easier to slip into Hindu or Mohammedan garb when engaged on
certain businesses. One of the young men of fashionâ he who was found
dead at the bottom of a well on the night of the earthquakeâ had once
"given him a complete suit of Hindu kit, the costume of a lowcaste"
"street boy, and Kim stored it in a secret place under some baulks in"
"Nila Ramâ s timber-yard, beyond the Punjab High Court, where the"
fragrant deodar logs lie seasoning after they have driven down the
"Ravi. When there was business or frolic afoot, Kim would use his"
"properties, returning at dawn to the veranda, all tired out from"
"shouting at the heels of a marriage procession, or yelling at a Hindu"
"festival. Sometimes there was food in the house, more often there was"
"not, and then Kim went out again to eat with his native friends."

As he drummed his heels against Zam-Zammah he turned now and again from
his king-of-the-castle game with little Chota Lal and Abdullah the
"sweetmeat-sellerâ s son, to make a rude remark to the native policeman"
on guard over rows of shoes at the Museum door. The big Punjabi grinned
"tolerantly: he knew Kim of old. So did the water-carrier, sluicing"
"water on the dry road from his goat-skin bag. So did Jawahir Singh, the"
"Museum carpenter, bent over new packing-cases. So did everybody in"
"sight except the peasants from the country, hurrying up to the Wonder"
House to view the things that men made in their own province and
"elsewhere. The Museum was given up to Indian arts and manufactures, and"
anybody who sought wisdom could ask the Curator to explain.

"â Off! Off! Let me up!â  cried Abdullah, climbing up Zam-Zammahâ s wheel."

"â Thy father was a pastry-cook, Thy mother stole the  ghi ,â  sang Kim."
â All Mussalmans fell off Zam-Zammah long ago!â 

â Let  me  up!â  shrilled little Chota Lal in his gilt-embroidered cap.
"His father was worth perhaps half a million sterling, but India is the"
only democratic land in the world.

â The Hindus fell off Zam-Zammah too. The Mussalmans pushed them off.
Thy father was a pastry-cookâ â 

"He stopped; for there shuffled round the corner, from the roaring Motee"
"Bazar, such a man as Kim, who thought he knew all castes, had never"
"seen. He was nearly six feet high, dressed in fold upon fold of dingy"
"stuff like horse-blanketing, and not one fold of it could Kim refer to"
any known trade or profession. At his belt hung a long open-work iron
pencase and a wooden rosary such as holy men wear. On his head was a
"gigantic sort of tam-oâ -shanter. His face was yellow and wrinkled, like"
"that of Fook Shing, the Chinese bootmaker in the bazar. His eyes turned"
up at the corners and looked like little slits of onyx.

â Who is that?â  said Kim to his companions.

"â Perhaps it is a man,â  said Abdullah, finger in mouth, staring."

"â Without doubt,â  returned Kim; â but he is no man of India that  I  have"
ever seen.â 

"â A priest, perhaps,â  said Chota Lal, spying the rosary. â See! He goes"
into the Wonder House!â 

"â Nay, nay,â  said the policeman, shaking his head. â I do not understand"
"your talk.â  The constable spoke Punjabi. â O Friend of all the World,"
what does he say?â 

"â Send him hither,â  said Kim, dropping from Zam-Zammah, flourishing his"
"bare heels. â He is a foreigner, and thou art a buffalo.â "

"The man turned helplessly and drifted towards the boys. He was old, and"
his woollen gaberdine still reeked of the stinking artemisia of the
mountain passes.

"â O Children, what is that big house?â  he said in very fair Urdu."

"â The Ajaib-Gher, the Wonder House!â  Kim gave him no titleâ such as Lala"
or Mian. He could not divine the manâ s creed.

â Ah! The Wonder House! Can any enter?â 

â It is written above the doorâ all can enter.â 

â Without payment?â 

"â I go in and out.  I  am no banker,â  laughed Kim."

"â Alas! I am an old man. I did not know.â  Then, fingering his rosary, he"
half turned to the Museum.

â What is your caste? Where is your house? Have you come far?â  Kim
asked.

â I came by Kuluâ from beyond the Kailasâ but what know you? From the
Hills whereâ â he sighedâ â the air and water are fresh and cool.â 

"â Aha! Khitai [a Chinaman],â  said Abdullah proudly. Fook Shing had once"
chased him out of his shop for spitting at the joss above the boots.

"â Pahari [a hillman],â  said little Chota Lal."

"â Aye, childâ a hillman from hills thouâ lt never see. Didst hear of"
"Bhotiyal [Tibet]? I am no Khitai, but a Bhotiya [Tibetan], since you"
"must knowâ a lamaâ or, say, a  guru  in your tongue.â "

"â A  guru  from Tibet,â  said Kim. â I have not seen such a man. They be"
"Hindus in Tibet, then?â "

"â We be followers of the Middle Way, living in peace in our lamasseries,"
"and I go to see the Four Holy Places before I die. Now do you, who are"
"children, know as much as I do who am old.â  He smiled benignantly on"
the boys.

â Hast thou eaten?â 

"He fumbled in his bosom and drew forth a worn, wooden begging-bowl. The"
boys nodded. All priests of their acquaintance begged.

â I do not wish to eat yet.â  He turned his head like an old tortoise in
the sunlight. â Is it true that there are many images in the Wonder
House of Lahore?â  He repeated the last words as one making sure of an
address.

"â That is true,â  said Abdullah. â It is full of heathen  bÅ«ts . Thou also"
art an idolater.â 

"â Never mind  him ,â  said. Kim. â That is the Governmentâ s house and"
"there is no idolatry in it, but only a Sahib with a white beard. Come"
with me and I will show.â 

"â Strange priests eat boys,â  whispered Chota Lal."

"â And he is a stranger and a  bÅ«t-parast  (idolater),â  said Abdullah,"
the Mohammedan.

"Kim laughed. â He is new. Run to your mothersâ  laps, and be safe. Come!â "

Kim clicked round the self-registering turnstile; the old man followed
and halted amazed. In the entrance-hall stood the larger figures of the
"Greco-Buddhist sculptures done, savants know how long since, by"
"forgotten workmen whose hands were feeling, and not unskilfully, for"
the mysteriously transmitted Grecian touch. There were hundreds of
"pieces, friezes of figures in relief, fragments of statues and slabs"
crowded with figures that had encrusted the brick walls of the Buddhist
" stupas  and  viharas  of the North Country and now, dug up and"
"labelled, made the pride of the Museum. In open-mouthed wonder the lama"
"turned to this and that, and finally checked in rapt attention before a"
large alto-relief representing a coronation or apotheosis of the Lord
Buddha. The Master was represented seated on a lotus the petals of
which were so deeply undercut as to show almost detached. Round Him was
"an adoring hierarchy of kings, elders, and old-time Buddhas. Below were"
lotus-covered waters with fishes and water-birds. Two butterfly-winged
devas held a wreath over His head; above them another pair supported an
umbrella surmounted by the jewelled headdress of the Bodhisat.

"â The Lord! The Lord! It is Sakya Muni himself,â  the lama half sobbed;"
and under his breath began the wonderful Buddhist invocation:

"â To Him the Way,â the Law,â Apartâ "
"Whom Maya held beneath her heart,"
Anandaâ s Lordâ the Bodhisat.â 

â And He is here! The Most Excellent Law is here also. My pilgrimage is
well begun. And what work! What work!â 

"â Yonder is the Sahib.â  said Kim, and dodged sideways among the cases of"
the arts and manufacturers wing. A white-bearded Englishman was looking
"at the lama, who gravely turned and saluted him and after some fumbling"
drew forth a note-book and a scrap of paper.

"â Yes, that is my name,â  smiling at the clumsy, childish print."

â One of us who had made pilgrimage to the Holy Placesâ he is now Abbot
"of the Lung-Cho Monasteryâ gave it me,â  stammered the lama. â He spoke of"
these.â  His lean hand moved tremulously round.

"â Welcome, then, O lama from Tibet. Here be the images, and I am"
hereâ â he glanced at the lamaâ s faceâ â to gather knowledge. Come to my
office awhile.â  The old man was trembling with excitement.

The office was but a little wooden cubicle partitioned off from the
"sculpture-lined gallery. Kim laid himself down, his ear against a crack"
"in the heat-split cedar door, and, following his instinct, stretched"
out to listen and watch.

"Most of the talk was altogether above his head. The lama, haltingly at"
"first, spoke to the Curator of his own lamassery, the Such-zen,"
"opposite the Painted Rocks, four monthsâ  march away. The Curator"
"brought out a huge book of photos and showed him that very place,"
"perched on its crag, overlooking the gigantic valley of many-hued"
strata.

"â Ay, ay!â  The lama mounted a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles of Chinese"
work. â Here is the little door through which we bring wood before
winter. And thouâ the English know of these things? He who is now Abbot
"of Lung-Cho told me, but I did not believe. The Lordâ the Excellent"
Oneâ He has honour here too? And His life is known?â 

"â It is all carven upon the stones. Come and see, if thou art rested.â "

"Out shuffled the lama to the main hall, and, the Curator beside him,"
went through the collection with the reverence of a devotee and the
appreciative instinct of a craftsman.

Incident by incident in the beautiful story he identified on the
"blurred stone, puzzled here and there by the unfamiliar Greek"
"convention, but delighted as a child at each new trove. Where the"
"sequence failed, as in the Annunciation, the Curator supplied it from"
"his mound of booksâ French and German, with photographs and"
reproductions.

"Here was the devout Asita, the pendant of Simeon in the Christian"
"story, holding the Holy Child on his knee while mother and father"
listened; and here were incidents in the legend of the cousin
Devadatta. Here was the wicked woman who accused the Master of
"impurity, all confounded; here was the teaching in the Deer-park; the"
miracle that stunned the fire-worshippers; here was the Bodhisat in
"royal state as a prince; the miraculous birth; the death at Kusinagara,"
where the weak disciple fainted; while there were almost countless
repetitions of the meditation under the Bodhi tree; and the adoration
of the alms-bowl was everywhere. In a few minutes the Curator saw that
"his guest was no mere bead-telling mendicant, but a scholar of parts."
"And they went at it all over again, the lama taking snuff, wiping his"
"spectacles, and talking at railway speed in a bewildering mixture of"
"Urdu and Tibetan. He had heard of the travels of the Chinese pilgrims,"
"Fu-Hiouen and Hwen-Tsiang, and was anxious to know if there was any"
translation of their record. He drew in his breath as he turned
helplessly over the pages of Beal and Stanislas Julien. â â Tis all here.
A treasure locked.â  Then he composed himself reverently to listen to
fragments hastily rendered into Urdu. For the first time he heard of
"the labours of European scholars, who by the help of these and a"
hundred other documents have identified the Holy Places of Buddhism.
"Then he was shown a mighty map, spotted and traced with yellow. The"
brown finger followed the Curatorâ s pencil from point to point. Here
"was Kapilavastu, here the Middle Kingdom, and here Mahabodhi, the Mecca"
"of Buddhism; and here was Kusinagara, sad place of the Holy Oneâ s"
death. The old man bowed his head over the sheets in silence for a
"while, and the Curator lit another pipe. Kim had fallen asleep. When he"
"waked, the talk, still in spate, was more within his comprehension."

"â And thus it was, O Fountain of Wisdom, that I decided to go to the"
"Holy Places which His foot had trodâ to the Birthplace, even to Kapila;"
"then to Mahabodhi, which is Buddh Gayaâ to the Monasteryâ to the"
Deer-parkâ to the place of His death.â 

The lama lowered his voice. â And I come here alone. For
fiveâ sevenâ eighteenâ forty years it was in my mind that the Old Law was
"not well followed; being overlaid, as thou knowest, with devildom,"
"charms, and idolatry. Even as the child outside said but now. Ay, even"
"as the child said, with  bÅ«t-parasti .â "

â So it comes with all faiths.â 

"â Thinkest thou? The books of my lamassery I read, and they were dried"
pith; and the later ritual with which we of the Reformed Law have
"cumbered ourselvesâ that, too, had no worth to these old eyes. Even the"
followers of the Excellent One are at feud on feud with one another. It
"is all illusion. Ay,  maya , illusion. But I have another desireâ â the"
"seamed yellow face drew within three inches of the Curator, and the"
"long forefinger-nail tapped on the table. â Your scholars, by these"
"books, have followed the Blessed Feet in all their wanderings; but"
there are things which they have not sought out. I know nothingâ nothing
do I knowâ but I go to free myself from the Wheel of Things by a broad
and open road.â  He smiled with most simple triumph. â As a pilgrim to
the Holy Places I acquire merit. But there is more. Listen to a true
"thing. When our gracious Lord, being as yet a youth, sought a mate, men"
"said, in His fatherâ s Court, that He was too tender for marriage. Thou"
knowest?â 

"The Curator nodded, wondering what would come next."

â So they made the triple trial of strength against all comers. And at
"the test of the Bow, our Lord first breaking that which they gave Him,"
called for such a bow as none might bend. Thou knowest?â 

â It is written. I have read.â 

"â And, overshooting all other marks, the arrow passed far and far beyond"
"sight. At the last it fell; and, where it touched earth, there broke"
"out a stream which presently became a River, whose nature, by our"
"Lordâ s beneficence, and that merit He acquired ere He freed himself, is"
that whoso bathes in it washes away all taint and speckle of sin.â 

"â So it is written,â  said the Curator sadly."

"The lama drew a long breath. â Where is that River? Fountain of Wisdom,"
where fell the arrow?â 

"â Alas, my brother, I do not know,â  said the Curator."

"â Nay, if it please thee to forgetâ the one thing only that thou hast not"
"told me. Surely thou must know? See, I am an old man! I ask with my"
"head between thy feet, O Fountain of Wisdom. We  know  He drew the bow!"
"We  know  the arrow fell! We know the stream gushed! Where, then, is"
the River? My dream told me to find it. So I came. I am here. But where
is the River?â 

"â If I knew, think you I would not cry it aloud?â "

"â By it one attains freedom from the Wheel of Things,â  the lama went on,"
"unheeding. â The River of the Arrow! Think again! Some little stream,"
maybeâ dried in the heats? But the Holy One would never so cheat an old
man.â 

â I do not know. I do not know.â 

The lama brought his thousand-wrinkled face once more a handsbreadth
"from the Englishmanâ s. â I see thou dost not know. Not being of the Law,"
the matter is hid from thee.â 

â Ayâ hiddenâ hidden.â 

"â We are both bound, thou and I, my brother. But Iâ â he rose with a sweep"
of the soft thick draperyâ â I go to cut myself free. Come also!â 

"â I am bound,â  said the Curator. â But whither goest thou?â "

â First to Kashi [Benares]: where else? There I shall meet one of the
pure faith in a Jain temple of that city. He also is a Seeker in
"secret, and from him haply I may learn. Maybe he will go with me to"
"Buddh Gaya. Thence north and west to Kapilavastu, and there will I seek"
"for the River. Nay, I will seek everywhere as I goâ for the place is not"
known where the arrow fell.â 

"â And how wilt thou go? It is a far cry to Delhi, and farther to"
Benares.â 

"â By road and the trains. From PathÃ¢nkot, having left the Hills, I came"
hither in a  te-rain . It goes swiftly. At first I was amazed to see
those tall poles by the side of the road snatching up and snatching up
"their threads,â â he illustrated the stoop and whirl of a telegraph-pole"
"flashing past the train. â But later, I was cramped and desired to walk,"
as I am used.â 

â And thou art sure of thy road?â  said the Curator.

"â Oh, for that one but asks a question and pays money, and the appointed"
persons despatch all to the appointed place. That much I knew in my
"lamassery from sure report,â  said the lama proudly."

â And when dost thou go?â  The Curator smiled at the mixture of old-world
piety and modern progress that is the note of India today.

â As soon as may be. I follow the places of His life till I come to the
"River of the Arrow. There is, moreover, a written paper of the hours of"
the trains that go south.â 

"â And for food?â  Lamas, as a rule, have good store of money somewhere"
"about them, but the Curator wished to make sure."

"â For the journey, I take up the Masterâ s begging-bowl. Yes. Even as He"
"went so go I, forsaking the ease of my monastery. There was with me"
when I left the hills a  chela  (disciple) who begged for me as the
"Rule demands, but halting in Kulu awhile a fever took him and he died."
"I have now no  chela , but I will take the alms-bowl and thus enable"
the charitable to acquire merit.â  He nodded his head valiantly. Learned
"doctors of a lamassery do not beg, but the lama was an enthusiast in"
this quest.

"â Be it so,â  said the Curator, smiling. â Suffer me now to acquire merit."
"We be craftsmen together, thou and I. Here is a new book of white"
"English paper: here be sharpened pencils two and threeâ thick and thin,"
all good for a scribe. Now lend me thy spectacles.â 

"The Curator looked through them. They were heavily scratched, but the"
"power was almost exactly that of his own pair, which he slid into the"
"lamaâ s hand, saying: â Try these.â "

â A feather! A very feather upon the face.â  The old man turned his head
delightedly and wrinkled up his nose. â How scarcely do I feel them! How
clearly do I see!â 

â They be  bilaur â crystalâ and will never scratch. May they help thee to
"thy River, for they are thine.â "

"â I will take them and the pencils and the white note-book,â  said the"
"lama, â as a sign of friendship between priest and priestâ and nowâ â  He"
"fumbled at his belt, detached the open-work iron pincers, and laid it"
on the Curatorâ s table. â That is for a memory between thee and meâ my
pencase. It is something oldâ even as I am.â 

"It was a piece of ancient design, Chinese, of an iron that is not"
smelted these days; and the collectorâ s heart in the Curatorâ s bosom
had gone out to it from the first. For no persuasion would the lama
resume his gift.

"â When I return, having found the River, I will bring thee a written"
picture of the Padma Samthora such as I used to make on silk at the
"lamassery. Yesâ and of the Wheel of Life,â  he chuckled, â for we be"
"craftsmen together, thou and I.â "

The Curator would have detained him: they are few in the world who
still have the secret of the conventional brush-pen Buddhist pictures
"which are, as it were, half written and half drawn. But the lama strode"
"out, head high in air, and pausing an instant before the great statue"
"of a Bodhisat in meditation, brushed through the turnstiles."

Kim followed like a shadow. What he had overheard excited him wildly.
"This man was entirely new to all his experience, and he meant to"
"investigate further, precisely as he would have investigated a new"
"building or a strange festival in Lahore city. The lama was his trove,"
"and he purposed to take possession. Kimâ s mother had been Irish, too."

The old man halted by Zam-Zammah and looked round till his eye fell on
"Kim. The inspiration of his pilgrimage had left him for awhile, and he"
"felt old, forlorn, and very empty."

"â Do not sit under that gun,â  said the policeman loftily."

â Huh! Owl!â  was Kimâ s retort on the lamaâ s behalf. â Sit under that gun
"if it please thee. When didst thou steal the milkwomanâ s slippers,"
Dunnoo?â 

"That was an utterly unfounded charge sprung on the spur of the moment,"
"but it silenced Dunnoo, who knew that Kimâ s clear yell could call up"
legions of bad bazaar boys if need arose.

"â And whom didst thou worship within?â  said Kim affably, squatting in"
the shade beside the lama.

"â I worshipped none, child. I bowed before the Excellent Law.â "

Kim accepted this new God without emotion. He knew already a few score.

â And what dost thou do?â 

â I beg. I remember now it is long since I have eaten or drunk. What is
"the custom of charity in this town? In silence, as we do of Tibet, or"
speaking aloud?â 

"â Those who beg in silence starve in silence,â  said Kim, quoting a"
"native proverb. The lama tried to rise, but sank back again, sighing"
"for his disciple, dead in far-away Kulu. Kim watched head to one side,"
considering and interested.

â Give me the bowl. I know the people of this cityâ all who are
"charitable. Give, and I will bring it back filled.â "

Simply as a child the old man handed him the bowl.

"â Rest, thou.  I  know the people.â "

"He trotted off to the open shop of a  kunjri , a low-caste"
"vegetable-seller, which lay opposite the belt-tramway line down the"
Motee Bazar. She knew Kim of old.

"â Oho, hast thou turned  yogi  with thy begging-bowl?â  she cried."

â Nay.â  said Kim proudly. â There is a new priest in the cityâ a man such
as I have never seen.â 

"â Old priestâ young tiger,â  said the woman angrily. â I am tired of new"
priests! They settle on our wares like flies. Is the father of my son a
well of charity to give to all who ask?â 

"â No,â  said Kim. â Thy man is rather  yagi  (bad-tempered) than  yogi  (a"
holy man). But this priest is new. The Sahib in the Wonder House has
"talked to him like a brother. O my mother, fill me this bowl. He"
waits.â 

â That bowl indeed! That cow-bellied basket! Thou hast as much grace as
the holy bull of Shiv. He has taken the best of a basket of onions
"already, this morn; and forsooth, I must fill thy bowl. He comes here"
again.â 

"The huge, mouse-coloured Brahmini bull of the ward was shouldering his"
"way through the many-coloured crowd, a stolen plantain hanging out of"
"his mouth. He headed straight for the shop, well knowing his privileges"
"as a sacred beast, lowered his head, and puffed heavily along the line"
of baskets ere making his choice. Up flew Kimâ s hard little heel and
"caught him on his moist blue nose. He snorted indignantly, and walked"
"away across the tram-rails, his hump quivering with rage."

"â See! I have saved more than the bowl will cost thrice over. Now,"
"mother, a little rice and some dried fish atopâ yes, and some vegetable"
curry.â 

"A growl came out of the back of the shop, where a man lay."

"â He drove away the bull,â  said the woman in an undertone. â It is good"
to give to the poor.â  She took the bowl and returned it full of hot
rice.

"â But my  yogi  is not a cow,â  said Kim gravely, making a hole with his"
"fingers in the top of the mound. â A little curry is good, and a fried"
"cake, and a morsel of conserve would please him, I think.â "

"â It is a hole as big as thy head,â  said the woman fretfully. But she"
"filled it, none the less, with good, steaming vegetable curry, clapped"
"a fried cake atop, and a morsel of clarified butter on the cake, dabbed"
a lump of sour tamarind conserve at the side; and Kim looked at the
load lovingly.

â That is good. When I am in the bazar the bull shall not come to this
house. He is a bold beggar-man.â 

â And thou?â  laughed the woman. â But speak well of bulls. Hast thou not
told me that some day a Red Bull will come out of a field to help thee?
Now hold all straight and ask for the holy manâ s blessing upon me.
"Perhaps, too, he knows a cure for my daughterâ s sore eyes. Ask. him"
"that also, O thou Little Friend of all the World.â "

"But Kim had danced off ere the end of the sentence, dodging pariah dogs"
and hungry acquaintances.

"â Thus do we beg who know the way of it,â  said he proudly to the lama,"
who opened his eyes at the contents of the bowl. â Eat now andâ I will
"eat with thee. OhÃ©  bhistie! â  he called to the water-carrier, sluicing"
the crotons by the Museum. â Give water here. We men are thirsty.â 

"â We men!â  said the  bhistie , laughing. â Is one skinful enough for such"
"a pair? Drink, then, in the name of the Compassionate.â "

"He loosed a thin stream into Kimâ s hands, who drank native fashion; but"
the lama must needs pull out a cup from his inexhaustible upper
draperies and drink ceremonially.

"â  Pardesi  (a foreigner),â  Kim explained, as the old man delivered in"
an unknown tongue what was evidently a blessing.

"They ate together in great content, clearing the beggingbowl. Then the"
"lama took snuff from a portentous wooden snuff-gourd, fingered his"
"rosary awhile, and so dropped into the easy sleep of age, as the shadow"
of Zam-Zammah grew long.

"Kim loafed over to the nearest tobacco-seller, a rather lively young"
"Mohammedan woman, and begged a rank cigar of the brand that they sell"
to students of the Punjab University who copy English customs. Then he
"smoked and thought, knees to chin, under the belly of the gun, and the"
outcome of his thoughts was a sudden and stealthy departure in the
direction of Nila Ramâ s timber-yard.

The lama did not wake till the evening life of the city had begun with
lamp-lighting and the return of white-robed clerks and subordinates
"from the Government offices. He stared dizzily in all directions, but"
none looked at him save a Hindu urchin in a dirty turban and
Isabella-coloured clothes. Suddenly he bowed his head on his knees and
wailed.

"â What is this?â  said the boy, standing before him. â Hast thou been"
robbed?â 

"â It is my new  chela  (disciple) that is gone away from me, and I know"
not where he is.â 

â And what like of man was thy disciple?â 

"â It was a boy who came to me in place of him who died, on account of"
the merit which I had gained when I bowed before the Law within there.â 
He pointed towards the Museum. â He came upon me to show me a road which
"I had lost. He led me into the Wonder House, and by his talk emboldened"
"me to speak to the Keeper of the Images, so that I was cheered and made"
"strong. And when I was faint with hunger he begged for me, as would a"
 chela  for his teacher. Suddenly was he sent. Suddenly has he gone
away. It was in my mind to have taught him the Law upon the road to
Benares.â 

"Kim stood amazed at this, because he had overheard the talk in the"
"Museum, and knew that the old man was speaking the truth, which is a"
thing a native on the road seldom presents to a stranger.

â But I see now that he was but sent for a purpose. By this I know that
I shall find a certain River for which I seek.â 

"â The River of the Arrow?â  said Kim, with a superior smile."

â Is this yet another Sending?â  cried the lama. â To none have I spoken
"of my search, save to the Priest of the Images. Who art thou?â "

"â Thy  chela ,â  said Kim simply, sitting on his heels. â I have never"
seen anyone like to thee in all this my life. I go with thee to
"Benares. And, too, I think that so old a man as thou, speaking the"
"truth to chance-met people at dusk, is in great need of a disciple.â "

â But the Riverâ the River of the Arrow?â 

"â Oh, that I heard when thou wast speaking to the Englishman. I lay"
against the door.â 

The lama sighed. â I thought thou hadst been a guide permitted. Such
"things fall sometimesâ but I am not worthy. Thou dost not, then, know"
the River?â 

"â Not I,â  Kim laughed uneasily. â I go to look forâ for a bullâ a Red. Bull"
"on a green field who shall help me.â  Boylike, if an acquaintance had a"
"scheme, Kim was quite ready with one of his own; and, boylike, he had"
really thought for as much as twenty minutes at a time of his fatherâ s
prophecy.

"â To what, child?â  said the lama."

"â God knows, but so my father told meâ . I heard thy talk in the Wonder"
"House of all those new strange places in the Hills, and if one so old"
and so littleâ so used to truth-tellingâ may go out for the small matter
"of a river, it seemed to me that I too must go a-travelling. If it is"
"our fate to find those things we shall find themâ thou, thy River; and"
"I, my Bull, and the Strong Pillars and some other matters that I"
forget.â 

"â It is not pillars but a Wheel from which I would be free,â  said the"
lama.

"â That is all one. Perhaps they will make me a king,â  said Kim, serenely"
prepared for anything.

"â I will teach thee other and better desires upon the road,â  the lama"
replied in the voice of authority. â Let us go to Benares.â 

â Not by night. Thieves are abroad. Wait till the day.â 

â But there is no place to sleep.â  The old man was used to the order of
"his monastery, and though he slept on the ground, as the Rule decrees,"
preferred a decency in these things.

"â We shall get good lodging at the Kashmir Serai,â  said Kim, laughing at"
his perplexity. â I have a friend there. Come!â 

The hot and crowded bazars blazed with light as they made their way
"through the press of all the races in Upper India, and the lama mooned"
through it like a man in a dream. It was his first experience of a
"large manufacturing city, and the crowded tram-car with its continually"
"squealing brakes frightened him. Half pushed, half towed, he arrived at"
the high gate of the Kashmir Serai: that huge open square over against
"the railway station, surrounded with arched cloisters, where the camel"
and horse caravans put up on their return from Central Asia. Here were
"all manner of Northern folk, tending tethered ponies and kneeling"
camels; loading and unloading bales and bundles; drawing water for the
evening meal at the creaking well-windlasses; piling grass before the
"shrieking, wild-eyed stallions; cuffing the surly caravan dogs; paying"
"off camel-drivers; taking on new grooms; swearing, shouting, arguing,"
"and chaffering in the packed square. The cloisters, reached by three or"
"four masonry steps, made a haven of refuge around this turbulent sea."
"Most of them were rented to traders, as we rent the arches of a"
viaduct; the space between pillar and pillar being bricked or boarded
"off into rooms, which were guarded by heavy wooden doors and cumbrous"
"native padlocks. Locked doors showed that the owner was away, and a few"
rudeâ sometimes very rudeâ chalk or paint scratches told where he had
"gone. Thus: â Lutuf Ullah is gone to Kurdistan.â  Below, in coarse verse:"
"â O Allah, who sufferest lice to live on the coat of a Kabuli, why hast"
thou allowed this louse Lutuf to live so long?â 

"Kim, fending the lama between excited men and excited beasts, sidled"
"along the cloisters to the far end, nearest therailway station, where"
"Mahbub Ali, the horse-trader, lived when he came in from that"
mysterious land beyond the Passes of the North.

"Kim had had many dealings with Mahbub in his little life, especially"
"between his tenth and his thirteenth yearâ and the big burly Afghan, his"
beard dyed scarlet with lime (for he was elderly and did not wish his
"grey hairs to show), knew the boyâ s value as a gossip. Sometimes he"
would tell Kim to watch a man who had nothing whatever to do with
horses: to follow him for one whole day and report every soul with whom
"he talked. Kim would deliver himself of his tale at evening, and Mahbub"
"would listen without a word or gesture. It was intrigue of some kind,"
Kim knew; but its worth lay in saying nothing whatever to anyone except
"Mahbub, who gave him beautiful meals all hot from the cookshop at the"
"head of the serai, and once as much as eight annas in money."

"â He is here,â  said Kim, hitting a bad-tempered camel on the nose. â OhÃ©,"
Mahbub Ali!â  He halted at a dark arch and slipped behind the bewildered
lama.

"The horse-trader, his deep, embroidered Bokhariot belt unloosed, was"
"lying on a pair of silk carpet saddle-bags, pulling lazily at an"
immense silver hookah. He turned his head very slightly at the cry; and
"seeing only the tall silent figure, chuckled in his deep chest."

â Allah! A lama! A Red Lama! It is far from Lahore to the Passes. What
dost thou do here?â 

The lama held out the begging-bowl mechanically.

â Godâ s curse on all unbelievers!â  said Mahbub. â I do not give to a
lousy Tibetan; but ask my Baltis over yonder behind the camels. They
"may value your blessings. Oh, horseboys, here is a countryman of yours."
See if he be hungry.â 

"A shaven, crouching Balti, who had come down with the horses, and who"
"was nominally some sort of degraded Buddhist, fawned upon the priest,"
and in thick gutturals besought the Holy One to sit at the horseboysâ 
fire.

"â Go!â  said Kim, pushing him lightly, and the lama strode away, leaving"
Kim at the edge of the cloister.

"â Go!â  said Mahbub Ali, returning to his hookah. â Little Hindu, run"
away. Godâ s curse on all unbelievers! Beg from those of my tail who are
of thy faith.â 

"â Maharaj,â  whined Kim, using the Hindu form of address, and thoroughly"
enjoying the situation; â my father is deadâ my mother is deadâ my stomach
is empty.â 

"â Beg from my men among the horses, I say. There must be some Hindus in"
my tail.â 

"â Oh, Mahbub Ali, but am  I  a Hindu?â  said Kim in English."

"The trader gave no sign of astonishment, but looked under shaggy"
eyebrows.

"â Little Friend of all the World,â  said he, â what is this?â "

â Nothing. I am now that holy manâ s disciple; and we go a pilgrimage
"togetherâ to Benares, he says. He is quite mad, and I am tired of Lahore"
city. I wish new air and water.â 

â But for whom dost thou work? Why come to me?â  The voice was harsh with
suspicion.

â To whom else should I come? I have no money. It is not good to go
about without money. Thou wilt sell many horses to the officers. They
"are very fine horses, these new ones: I have seen them. Give me a"
"rupee, Mahbub Ali, and when I come to my wealth I will give thee a bond"
and pay.â 

"â Um!â  said Mahbub Ali, thinking swiftly. â Thou hast never before lied"
to me. Call that lamaâ stand back in the dark.â 

"â Oh, our tales will agree,â  said Kim, laughing."

"â We go to Benares,â  said the lama, as soon as he understood the drift"
"of Mahbub Aliâ s questions. â The boy and I, I go to seek for a certain"
River.â 

â Maybeâ but the boy?â 

"â He is my disciple. He was sent, I think, to guide me to that River."
Sitting under a gun was I when he came suddenly. Such things have
befallen the fortunate to whom guidance was allowed. But I remember
"now, he said he was of this worldâ a Hindu.â "

â And his name?â 

â That I did not ask. Is he not my disciple?â 

â His countryâ his raceâ his village? Mussalmanâ Sikh Hinduâ Jainâ low caste
or high?â 

â Why should I ask? There is neither high nor low in the Middle Way. If
"he is my  chela â doesâ willâ can anyone take him from me? for, look you,"
without him I shall not find my River.â  He wagged his head solemnly.

"â None shall take him from thee. Go, sit among my Baltis,â  said Mahbub"
"Ali, and the lama drifted off, soothed by the promise."

"â Is he not quite mad?â  said Kim, coming forward to the light again."
"â Why should I lie to thee, Hajji?â "

"Mahbub puffed his hookah in silence. Then he began, almost whispering:"
â Umballa is on the road to Benaresâ if indeed ye two go there.â 

â Tck! Tck! I tell thee he does not know how to lieâ as we two know.â 

"â And if thou wilt carry a message for me as far as Umballa, I will give"
thee money. It concerns a horseâ a white stallion which I have sold to
an officer upon the last time I returned from the Passes. But
thenâ stand nearer and hold up hands as beggingâ the pedigree of the
"white stallion was not fully established, and that officer, who is now"
"at Umballa, bade me make it clear.â  (Mahbub here described the horse"
and the appearance of the officer.) â So the message to that officer
will be: â€˜The pedigree of the white stallion is fully established.â  By
this will he know that thou comest from me. He will then say â€˜What
proof hast thou?â  and thou wilt answer: â€˜Mahbub Ali has given me the
proof.â â 

"â And all for the sake of a white stallion,â  said Kim, with a giggle,"
his eyes aflame.

â That pedigree I will give thee nowâ in my own fashion and some hard
"words as well.â  A shadow passed behind Kim, and a feeding camel. Mahbub"
Ali raised his voice.

â Allah! Art thou the only beggar in the city? Thy mother is dead. Thy
"father is dead. So is it with all of them. Well, wellâ â "

"He turned as feeling on the floor beside him and tossed a flap of soft,"
greasy Mussalman bread to the boy. â Go and lie down among my horseboys
for tonightâ thou and the lama. Tomorrow I may give thee service.â 

"Kim slunk away, his teeth in the bread, and, as he expected, he found a"
"small wad of folded tissue-paper wrapped in oilskin, with three silver"
rupeesâ enormous largesse. He smiled and thrust money and paper into his
"leather amulet-case. The lama, sumptuously fed by Mahbubâ s Baltis, was"
already asleep in a corner of one of the stalls. Kim lay down beside
"him and laughed. He knew he had rendered a service to Mahbub Ali, and"
not for one little minute did he believe the tale of the stallionâ s
pedigree.

"But Kim did not suspect that Mahbub Ali, known as one of the best"
"horse-dealers in the Punjab, a wealthy and enterprising trader, whose"
"caravans penetrated far and far into the Back of Beyond, was registered"
in one of the locked books of the Indian Survey Department as C25 IB.
"Twice or thrice yearly C25 would send in a little story, baldly told"
"but most interesting, and generallyâ it was checked by the statements of"
R17 and M4â quite true. It concerned all manner of out-of-the-way
"mountain principalities, explorers of nationalities other than English,"
"and the guntradeâ was, in brief, a small portion of that vast mass of"
"â information receivedâ  on which the Indian Government acts. But,"
"recently, five confederated Kings, who had no business to confederate,"
had been informed by a kindly Northern Power that there was a leakage
of news from their territories into British India. So those Kingsâ 
"Prime Ministers were seriously annoyed and took steps, after the"
"Oriental fashion. They suspected, among many others, the bullying,"
red-bearded horsedealer whose caravans ploughed through their
"fastnesses belly-deep in snow. At least, his caravan that season had"
"been ambushed and shot at twice on the way down, when Mahbubâ s men"
"accounted for three strange ruffians who might, or might not, have been"
hired for the job. Therefore Mahbub had avoided halting at the
"insalubrious city of Peshawur, and had come through without stop to"
"Lahore, where, knowing his country-people, he anticipated curious"
developments.

And there was that on Mahbub Ali which he did not wish to keep an hour
"longer than was necessaryâ a wad of closely folded tissue-paper, wrapped"
"in oilskinâ an impersonal, unaddressed statement, with five microscopic"
"pin-holes in one corner, that most scandalously betrayed the five"
"confederated Kings, the sympathetic Northern Power, a Hindu banker in"
"Peshawur, a firm of gun-makers in Belgium, and an important,"
semi-independent Mohammedan ruler to the south. This last was R17â s
"work, which Mahbub had picked up beyond the Dora Pass and was carrying"
"in for R17, who, owing to circumstances over which he had no control,"
could not leave his post of observation. Dynamite was milky and
"innocuous beside that report of C25; and even an Oriental, with an"
"Orientalâ s views of the value of time, could see that the sooner it was"
in the proper hands the better. Mahbub had no particular desire to die
"by violence, because two or three family blood-feuds across the Border"
"hung unfinished on his hands, and when these scores were cleared he"
intended to settle down as a more or less virtuous citizen. He had
"never passed the serai gate since his arrival two days ago, but had"
"been ostentatious in sending telegrams to Bombay, where he banked some"
"of his money; to Delhi, where a sub-partner of his own clan was selling"
"horses to the agent of a Rajputana state; and to Umballa, where an"
Englishman was excitedly demanding the pedigree of a white stallion.
"The public letter-writer, who knew English, composed excellent"
"telegrams, such as: â  Creighton, Laurel Bank, Umballa. Horse is Arabian"
as already advised. Sorrowful delayed pedigree which am translating. â 
And later to the same address: â  Much sorrowful delay. Will forward
pedigree. â  To his sub-partner at Delhi he wired: â  Lutuf Ullah. Have
wired two thousand rupees your credit Luchman Narainâ s bank. â â  This
"was entirely in the way of trade, but every one of those telegrams was"
"discussed and rediscussed, by parties who conceived themselves to be"
"interested, before they went over to the railway station in charge of a"
"foolish Balti, who allowed all sorts of people to read them on the"
road.

"When, in Mahbubâ s own picturesque language, he had muddied the wells of"
"inquiry with the stick of precaution, Kim had dropped on him, sent from"
"Heaven; and, being as prompt as he was unscrupulous, Mahbub Ali used to"
"taking all sorts of gusty chances, pressed him into service on the"
spot.

A wandering lama with a low-caste boy-servant might attract a momentâ s
"interest as they wandered about India, the land of pilgrims; but no one"
"would suspect them or, what was more to the point, rob."

"He called for a new light-ball to his hookah, and considered the case."
"If the worst came to the worst, and the boy came to harm, the paper"
would incriminate nobody. And he would go up to Umballa leisurely
andâ at a certain risk of exciting fresh suspicionâ repeat his tale by
word of mouth to the people concerned.

"But R17â s report was the kernel of the whole affair, and it would be"
"distinctly inconvenient if that failed to come to hand. However, God"
"was great, and Mahbub Ali felt he had done all he could for the time"
being. Kim was the one soul in the world who had never told him a lie.
That would have been a fatal blot on Kimâ s character if Mahbub had not
"known that to others, for his own ends or Mahbubâ s business, Kim could"
lie like an Oriental.

Then Mahbub Ali rolled across the serai to the Gate of the Harpies who
"paint their eyes and trap the stranger, and was at some pains to call"
"on the one girl who, he had reason to believe, was a particular friend"
of a smooth-faced Kashmiri pundit who had waylaid his simple Balti in
the matter of the telegrams. It was an utterly foolish thing to do;
because they fell to drinking perfumed brandy against the Law of the
"Prophet, and Mahbub grew wonderfully drunk, and the gates of his mouth"
"were loosened, and he pursued the Flower of Delight with the feet of"
"intoxication till he fell flat among the cushions, where the Flower of"
"Delight, aided by a smooth-faced Kashmiri pundit, searched him from"
head to foot most thoroughly.

About the same hour Kim heard soft feet in Mahbubâ s deserted stall. The
"horse-trader, curiously enough, had left his door unlocked, and his men"
were busy celebrating their return to India with a whole sheep of
"Mahbubâ s bounty. A sleek young gentleman from Delhi, armed with a bunch"
"of keys which the Flower had unshackled from the senseless oneâ s belt,"
"went through every single box, bundle, mat, and saddle-bag in Mahbubâ s"
possession even more systematically than the Flower and the pundit were
searching the owner.

"â And I think.â  said the Flower scornfully an hour later, one rounded"
"elbow on the snoring carcass, â that he is no more than a pig of an"
"Afghan horse-dealer, with no thought except women and horses. Moreover,"
he may have sent it away by nowâ if ever there were such a thing.â 

"â Nayâ in a matter touching Five Kings it would be next his black heart,â "
said the pundit. â Was there nothing?â 

The Delhi man laughed and resettled his turban as he entered. â I
searched between the soles of his slippers as the Flower searched his
clothes. This is not the man but another. I leave little unseen.â 

"â They did not say he was the very man,â  said the pundit thoughtfully."
"â They said, â€˜Look if he be the man, since our counsels are troubled.â â "

â That North country is full of horse-dealers as an old coat of lice.
"There is Sikandar Khan, Nur Ali Beg, and Farrukh Shah all heads of"
"kafilas [caravans]â who deal there,â  said the Flower."

"â They have not yet come in,â  said the pundit. â Thou must ensnare them"
later.â 

"Phew!â  said the Flower with deep disgust, rolling Mahbubâ s head from"
"her lap. â I earn my money. Farrukh Shah is a bear, Ali Beg a"
"swashbuckler, and old Sikandar Khanâ yaie! Go! I sleep now. This swine"
will not stir till dawn.â 

"When Mahbub woke, the Flower talked to him severely on the sin of"
drunkenness. Asiatics do not wink when they have outmanoeuvred an
"enemy, but as Mahbub Ali cleared his throat, tightened his belt, and"
"staggered forth under the early morning stars, he came very near to it."

â What a coltâ s trick!â  said he to himself. â As if every girl in
Peshawur did not use it! But â twas prettily done. Now God He knows how
many more there be upon the Road who have orders to test meâ perhaps
with the knife. So it stands that the boy must go to Umballaâ and by
"railâ for the writing is something urgent. I abide here, following the"
Flower and drinking wine as an Afghan coper should.â 

He halted at the stall next but one to his own. His men lay there heavy
with sleep. There was no sign of Kim or the lama.

â Up!â  He stirred a sleeper. â Whither went those who lay here last
evenâ the lama and the boy? Is aught missing?â 

"â Nay,â  grunted the man, â the old madman rose at second cockcrow saying"
"he would go to Benares, and the young one led him away.â "

"â The curse of Allah on all unbelievers!â  said Mahbub heartily, and"
"climbed into his own stall, growling in his beard."

But it was Kim who had wakened the lamaâ Kim with one eye laid against a
"knot-hole in the planking, who had seen the Delhi manâ s search through"
"the boxes. This was no common thief that turned over letters, bills,"
and saddlesâ no mere burglar who ran a little knife sideways into the
"soles of Mahbubâ s slippers, or picked the seams of the saddle-bags so"
deftly. At first Kim had been minded to give the alarmâ the long-drawn
 cho-orâ choor!  (thief! thief!) that sets the serai ablaze of nights;
"but he looked more carefully, and, hand on amulet, drew his own"
conclusions.

"â It must be the pedigree of that made-up horse-lie,â  said he, â the"
thing that I carry to Umballa. Better that we go now. Those who search
bags with knives may presently search bellies with knives. Surely there
is a woman behind this. Hai! Hai! in a whisper to the light-sleeping
old man. â Come. It is timeâ time to go to Benares.â 

"The lama rose obediently, and they passed out of the serai like"
shadows.




CHAPTER II


"And whoso will, from Pride released;"
"Contemning neither creed nor priest,"
May feel the Soul of all the East.
About him at Kamakura.

"They entered the fort-like railway station, black in the end of night;"
the electrics sizzling over the goods-yard where they handle the heavy
Northern grain-traffic.

"â This is the work of devils!â  said the lama, recoiling from the hollow"
"echoing darkness, the glimmer of rails between the masonry platforms,"
"and the maze of girders above. He stood in a gigantic stone hall paved,"
"it seemed, with the sheeted dead third-class passengers who had taken"
their tickets overnight and were sleeping in the waiting-rooms. All
"hours of the twenty-four are alike to Orientals, and their passenger"
traffic is regulated accordingly.

â This is where the fire-carriages come. One stands behind that
holeâ â Kim pointed to the ticket-officeâ â who will give thee a paper to
take thee to Umballa.â 

"â But we go to Benares,â  he replied petulantly."

â All one. Benares then. Quick: she comes!â 

â Take thou the purse.â 

"The lama, not so well used to trains as he had pretended, started as"
"the 3.25 a.m. south-bound roared in. The sleepers sprang to life, and"
"the station filled with clamour and shoutings, cries of water and"
"sweetmeat vendors, shouts of native policemen, and shrill yells of"
"women gathering up their baskets, their families, and their husbands."

â It is the trainâ only the  te-rain . It will not come here. Wait!â 
Amazed at the lamaâ s immense simplicity (he had handed him a small bag
"full of rupees), Kim asked and paid for a ticket to Umballa. A sleepy"
"clerk grunted and flung out a ticket to the next station, just six"
miles distant.

"â Nay,â  said Kim, scanning it with a grin. â This may serve for farmers,"
"but I live in the city of Lahore. It was cleverly done, Babu. Now give"
the ticket to Umballa.â 

The Babu scowled and dealt the proper ticket.

"â Now another to Amritzar,â  said Kim, who had no notion of spending"
Mahbub Aliâ s money on anything so crude as a paid ride to Umballa. â The
price is so much. The small money in return is just so much. I know the
"ways of the  te-rain  ... Never did  yogi  need  chela  as thou dost,â "
he went on merrily to the bewildered lama. â They would have flung thee
"out at Mian Mir but for me. This way! Come!â  He returned the money,"
keeping only one anna in each rupee of the price of the Umballa ticket
as his commissionâ the immemorial commission of Asia.

The lama jibbed at the open door of a crowded third-class carriage.
â Were it not better to walk?â  said he weakly.

A burly Sikh artisan thrust forth his bearded head. â Is he afraid? Do
not be afraid. I remember the time when I was afraid of the train.
Enter! This thing is the work of the Government.â 

"â I do not fear,â  said the lama. â Have ye room within for two?â "

"â There is no room even for a mouse,â  shrilled the wife of a well-to-do"
"cultivatorâ a Hindu Jat from the rich Jullundur, district. Our night"
"trains are not as well looked after as the day ones, where the sexes"
are very strictly kept to separate carriages.

"â Oh, mother of my son, we can make space,â  said the blueturbaned"
"husband. â Pick up the child. It is a holy man, seeâ st thou?â "

â And my lap full of seventy times seven bundles! Why not bid him sit on
"my knee, Shameless? But men are ever thus!â  She looked round for"
approval. An Amritzar courtesan near the window sniffed behind her head
drapery.

"â Enter! Enter!â  cried a fat Hindu money-lender, his folded account-book"
in a cloth under his arm. With an oily smirk: â It is well to be kind to
the poor.â 

"â Ay, at seven per cent a month with a mortgage on the unborn calf,â "
said a young Dogra soldier going south on leave; and they all laughed.

â Will it travel to Benares?â  said the lama.

"â Assuredly. Else why should we come? Enter, or we are left,â  cried Kim."

"â See!â  shrilled the Amritzar girl. â He has never entered a train. Oh,"
see!â 

"â Nay, help,â  said the cultivator, putting out a large brown hand and"
"hauling him in. â Thus is it done, father.â "

"â Butâ butâ I sit on the floor. It is against the Rule to sit on a bench,â "
"said the lama. â Moreover, it cramps me.â "

"â I say,â  began the money-lender, pursing his lips, â that there is not"
one rule of right living which these  te-rains  do not cause us to
"break. We sit, for example, side by side with all castes and peoples.â "

"â Yea, and with most outrageously shameless ones,â  said the wife,"
scowling at the Amritzar girl making eyes at the young sepoy.

"â I said we might have gone by cart along the road,â  said the husband,"
â and thus have saved some money.â 

â Yesâ and spent twice over what we saved on food by the way. That was
talked out ten thousand times.â 

"â Ay, by ten thousand tongues,â  grunted he."

â The Gods help us poor women if we may not speak. Oho! He is of that
"sort which may not look at or reply to a woman.â  For the lama,"
"constrained by his Rule, took not the faintest notice of her. â And his"
disciple is like him?â 

"â Nay, mother,â  said Kim most promptly. â Not when the woman is"
well-looking and above all charitable to the hungry.â 

"â A beggarâ s answer,â  said the Sikh, laughing. â Thou hast brought it on"
"thyself, sister!â  Kimâ s hands were crooked in supplication."

"â And whither goest thou?â  said the woman, handing him the half of a"
cake from a greasy package.

â Even to Benares.â 

â Jugglers belike?â  the young soldier suggested. â Have ye any tricks to
pass the time? Why does not that yellow man answer?â 

"â Because,â  said Kim stoutly, â he is holy, and thinks upon matters"
hidden from thee.â 

â That may be well. We of the Ludhiana Sikhsâ â he rolled it out
sonorouslyâ â do not trouble our heads with doctrine. We fight.â 

"â My sisterâ s brotherâ s son is  naik  (corporal) in that regiment,â  said"
the Sikh craftsman quietly. â There are also some Dogra companies
"there.â  The soldier glared, for a Dogra is of other caste than a Sikh,"
and the banker tittered.

"â They are all one to me,â  said the Amritzar girl."

"â That we believe,â  snorted the cultivatorâ s wife malignantly."

"â Nay, but all who serve the Sirkar with weapons in their hands are, as"
"it were, one brotherhood. There is one brotherhood of the caste, but"
beyond that againâ â she looked round timidlyâ â the bond of the
 Pulton â the Regimentâ eh?â 

"â My brother is in a Jat regiment,â  said the cultivator. â Dogras be good"
men.â 

"â Thy Sikhs at least were of that opinion,â  said the soldier, with a"
scowl at the placid old man in the corner. â  Thy  Sikhs thought so when
our two companies came to help them at the Pirzai Kotal in the face of
eight Afridi standards on the ridge not three months gone.â 

He told the story of a Border action in which the Dogra companies of
the Ludhiana Sikhs had acquitted themselves well. The Amritzar girl
smiled; for she knew the talk was to win her approval.

â Alas!â  said the cultivatorâ s wife at the end. â So their villages were
burnt and their little children made homeless?â 

â They had marked our dead. They paid a great payment after we of the
Sikhs had schooled them. So it was. Is this Amritzar?â 

"â Ay, and here they cut our tickets,â  said the banker, fumbling at his"
belt.

The lamps were paling in the dawn when the half-caste guard came round.
"Ticket-collecting is a slow business in the East, where people secrete"
their tickets in all sorts of curious places. Kim produced his and was
told to get out.

"â But I go to Umballa,â  he protested. â I go with this holy man.â "

â Thou canst go to Jehannum for aught I care. This ticket is onlyâ â 

"Kim burst into a flood of tears, protesting that the lama was his"
"father and his mother, that he was the prop of the lamaâ s declining"
"years, and that the lama would die without his care. All the carriage"
bade the guard be mercifulâ the banker was specially eloquent hereâ but
the guard hauled Kim on to the platform. The lama blinkedâ he could not
overtake the situation and Kim lifted up his voice and wept outside the
carriage window.

â I am very poor. My father is deadâ my mother is dead. O charitable
"ones, if I am left here, who shall tend that old man?â "

â Whatâ what is this?â  the lama repeated. â He must go to Benares. He must
come with me. He is my  chela . If there is money to be paidâ â 

"â Oh, be silent,â  whispered Kim; â are we Rajahs to throw away good"
silver when the world is so charitable?â 

"The Amritzar girl stepped out with her bundles, and it was on her that"
"Kim kept his watchful eye. Ladies of that persuasion, he knew, were"
generous.

â A ticketâ a little  tikkut  to Umballaâ O Breaker of Hearts!â  She
laughed. â Hast thou no charity?â 

â Does the holy man come from the North?â 

"â From far and far in the North he comes,â  cried Kim. â From among the"
hills.â 

â There is snow among the pine-trees in the Northâ in the hills there is
snow. My mother was from Kulu. Get thee a ticket. Ask him for a
blessing.â 

"â Ten thousand blessings,â  shrilled Kim. â O Holy One, a woman has given"
us in charity so that I can come with theeâ a woman with a golden heart.
I run for the  tikkut .â 

"The girl looked up at the lama, who had mechanically followed Kim to"
"the platform. He bowed his head that he might not see her, and muttered"
in Tibetan as she passed on with the crowd.

"â Light comeâ light go,â  said the cultivatorâ s wife viciously."

"â She has acquired merit,â  returned the lama. â Beyond doubt it was a"
nun.â 

"â There be ten thousand such nuns in Amritzar alone. Return, old man, or"
"the  te-rain  may depart without thee,â  cried the banker."

"â Not only was it sufficient for the ticket, but for a little food"
"also,â  said Kim, leaping to his place. â Now eat, Holy One. Look. Day"
comes!â 

"Golden, rose, saffron, and pink, the morning mists smoked away across"
the flat green levels. All the rich Punjab lay out in the splendour of
the keen sun. The lama flinched a little as the telegraph-posts swung
by.

"â Great is the speed of the  te-rain ,â  said the banker, with a"
patronizing grin. â We have gone farther since Lahore than thou couldst
"walk in two days: at even, we shall enter Umballa.â "

"â And that is still far from Benares,â  said the lama wearily, mumbling"
over the cakes that Kim offered. They all unloosed their bundles and
"made their morning meal. Then the banker, the cultivator, and the"
"soldier prepared their pipes and wrapped the compartment in choking,"
"acrid smoke, spitting and coughing and enjoying themselves. The Sikh"
and the cultivatorâ s wife chewed  pan;  the lama took snuff and told
"his beads, while Kim, cross-legged, smiled over the comfort of a full"
stomach.

â What rivers have ye by Benares?â  said the lama of a sudden to the
carriage at large.

"â We have Gunga,â  returned the banker, when the little titter had"
subsided.

â What others?â 

â What other than Gunga?â 

"â Nay, but in my mind was the thought of a certain River of healing.â "

â That is Gunga. Who bathes in her is made clean and goes to the Gods.
Thrice have I made pilgrimage to Gunga.â  He looked round proudly.

"â There was need,â  said the young sepoy drily, and the travellersâ  laugh"
turned against the banker.

"â Cleanâ to return again to the Gods,â  the lama muttered. â And to go"
forth on the round of lives anewâ still tied to the Wheel.â  He shook his
"head testily. â But maybe there is a mistake. Who, then, made Gunga in"
the beginning?â 

"â The Gods. Of what known faith art thou?â  the banker said, appalled."

â I follow the Lawâ the Most Excellent Law. So it was the Gods that made
Gunga. What like of Gods were they?â 

The carriage looked at him in amazement. It was inconceivable that
anyone should be ignorant of Gunga.

â Whatâ what is thy God?â  said the money-lender at last.

"â Hear!â  said the lama, shifting the rosary to his hand. â Hear: for I"
"speak of Him now! O people of Hind, listen!â "

"He began in Urdu the tale of the Lord Buddha, but, borne by his own"
"thoughts, slid into Tibetan and long-droned texts from a Chinese book"
"of the Buddhaâ s life. The gentle, tolerant folk looked on reverently."
All India is full of holy men stammering gospels in strange tongues;
"shaken and consumed in the fires of their own zeal; dreamers, babblers,"
and visionaries: as it has been from the beginning and will continue to
the end.

â Um!â  said the soldier of the Ludhiana Sikhs. â There was a Mohammedan
"regiment lay next to us at the Pirzai Kotal, and a priest of theirsâ he"
"was, as I remember, a  naik â when the fit was on him, spake prophecies."
But the mad all are in Godâ s keeping. His officers overlooked much in
that man.â 

"The lama fell back on Urdu, remembering that he was in a strange land."
"â Hear the tale of the Arrow which our Lord loosed from the bow,â  he"
said.

"This was much more to their taste, and they listened curiously while he"
"told it. â Now, O people of Hind, I go to seek that River. Know ye aught"
"that may guide me, for we be all men and women in evil case.â "

â There is Gungaâ and Gunga aloneâ who washes away sin.â  ran the murmur
round the carriage.

"â Though past question we have good Gods Jullundur-way,â  said the"
"cultivatorâ s wife, looking out of the window. â See how they have"
blessed the crops.â 

"â To search every river in the Punjab is no small matter,â  said her"
"husband. â For me, a stream that leaves good silt on my land suffices,"
"and I thank Bhumia, the God of the Home-stead.â  He shrugged one"
"knotted, bronzed shoulder."

"â Think you our Lord came so far North?â  said the lama, turning to Kim."

"â It may be,â  Kim replied soothingly, as he spat red  pan -juice on the"
floor.

"â The last of the Great Ones,â  said the Sikh with authority, â was"
Sikander Julkarn [Alexander the Great]. He paved the streets of
Jullundur and built a great tank near Umballa. That pavement holds to
this day; and the tank is there also. I never heard of thy God.â 

"â Let thy hair grow long and talk Punjabi,â  said the young soldier"
"jestingly to Kim, quoting a Northern proverb. â That is all that makes a"
Sikh.â  But he did not say this very loud.

"The lama sighed and shrank into himself, a dingy, shapeless mass. In"
the pauses of their talk they could hear the low droning â  Om mane
pudme hum! Om mane pudme hum! â â and the thick click of the wooden
rosary beads.

"â It irks me,â  he said at last. â The speed and the clatter irk me."
"Moreover, my  chela , I think that maybe we have over-passed that"
River.â 

"â Peace, peace,â  said Kim. â Was not the River near Benares? We are yet"
far from the place.â 

"â Butâ if our Lord came North, it may be any one of these little ones"
that we have run across.â 

â I do not know.â 

â But thou wast sent to meâ wast thou sent to me?â for the merit I had
acquired over yonder at Such-zen. From beside the cannon didst thou
comeâ bearing two facesâ and two garbs.â 

"â Peace. One must not speak of these things here,â  whispered Kim. â There"
was but one of me. Think again and thou wilt remember. A boyâ a Hindu
boyâ by the great green cannon.â 

â But was there not also an Englishman with a white beard holy among
imagesâ who himself made more sure my assurance of the River of the
Arrow?â 

"â Heâ weâ went to the Ajaib-Gher in Lahore to pray before the Gods there,â "
Kim explained to the openly listening company. â And the Sahib of the
"Wonder House talked to himâ yes, this is truth as a brother. He is a"
"very holy man, from far beyond the Hills. Rest, thou. In time we come"
to Umballa.â 

â But my Riverâ the River of my healing?â 

"â And then, if it please thee, we will go hunting for that River on"
foot. So that we miss nothingâ not even a little rivulet in a
field-side.â 

â But thou hast a Search of thine own?â  The lamaâ very pleased that he
remembered so wellâ sat bolt upright.

"â Ay,â  said Kim, humouring him. The boy was entirely happy to be out"
chewing  pan  and seeing new people in the great good-tempered world.

â It was a bullâ a Red Bull that shall come and help thee and carry
"theeâ whither? I have forgotten. A Red Bull on a green field, was it"
not?â 

"â Nay, it will carry me nowhere,â  said Kim. â It is but a tale I told"
thee.â 

"â What is this?â  The cultivatorâ s wife leaned forward, her bracelets"
clinking on her arm. â Do ye both dream dreams? A Red Bull on a green
"field, that shall carry thee to the heavens or what? Was it a vision?"
Did one make a prophecy?  We  have a Red Bull in our village behind
"Jullundur city, and he grazes by choice in the very greenest of our"
fields!â 

â Give a woman an old wifeâ s tale and a weaver-bird a leaf and a
"threadâ , they will weave wonderful things,â  said the Sikh. â All holy"
"men dream dreams, and by following holy men their disciples attain that"
power.â 

"â A Red Bull on a green field, was it?â  the lama repeated. â In a former"
"life it may be thou hast acquired merit, and the Bull will come to"
reward thee.â 

â Nayâ nayâ it was but a tale one told to meâ for a jest belike. But I will
"seek the Bull about Umballa, and thou canst look for thy River and rest"
from the clatter of the train.â 

â It may be that the Bull knowsâ that he is sent to guide us both.â  said
"the lama, hopefully as a child. Then to the company, indicating Kim:"
"â This one was sent to me but yesterday. He is not, I think, of this"
world.â 

"â Beggars aplenty have I met, and holy men to boot, but never such a"
" yogi  nor such a disciple,â  said the woman."

Her husband touched his forehead lightly with one finger and smiled.
But the next time the lama would eat they took care to give him of
their best.

"And at lastâ tired, sleepy, and dustyâ they reached Umballa City Station."

"â We abide here upon a law-suit,â  said the cultivatorâ s wife to Kim. â We"
lodge with my manâ s cousinâ s younger brother. There is room also in the
courtyard for thy  yogi  and for thee. Willâ will he give me a
blessing?â 

â O holy man! A woman with a heart of gold gives us lodging for the
"night. It is a kindly land, this land of the South. See how we have"
been helped since the dawn!â 

The lama bowed his head in benediction.

â To fill my cousinâ s younger brotherâ s house with wastrelsâ â  the
"husband began, as he shouldered his heavy bamboo staff."

â Thy cousinâ s younger brother owes my fatherâ s cousin something yet on
"his daughterâ s marriage-feast,â  said the woman crisply. â Let him put"
"their food to that account. The  yogi  will beg, I doubt not.â "

"â Ay, I beg for him,â  said Kim, anxious only to get the lama under"
"shelter for the night, that he might seek Mahbub Aliâ s Englishman and"
deliver himself of the white stallionâ s pedigree.

"â Now,â  said he, when the lama had come to an anchor in the inner"
"courtyard of a decent Hindu house behind the cantonments, â I go away"
for a whileâ toâ to buy us victual in the bazar. Do not stray abroad till
I return.â 

â Thou wilt return? Thou wilt surely return?â  The old man caught at his
wrist. â And thou wilt return in this very same shape? Is it too late to
look tonight for the River?â 

â Too late and too dark. Be comforted. Think how far thou art on the
roadâ an hundred  kos  from Lahore already.â 

â Yeaâ and farther from my monastery. Alas! It is a great and terrible
world.â 

"Kim stole out and away, as unremarkable a figure as ever carried his"
own and a few score thousand other folkâ s fate slung round his neck.
Mahbub Aliâ s directions left him little doubt of the house in which his
"Englishman lived; and a groom, bringing a dog-cart home from the Club,"
"made him quite sure. It remained only to identify his man, and Kim"
slipped through the garden hedge and hid in a clump of plumed grass
"close to the veranda. The house blazed with lights, and servants moved"
"about tables dressed with flowers, glass, and silver. Presently forth"
"came an Englishman, dressed in black and white, humming a tune. It was"
"too dark to see his face, so Kim, beggar-wise, tried an old experiment."

â Protector of the Poor!â 

The man backed towards the voice.

â Mahbub Ali saysâ â 

â Hah! What says Mahbub Ali?â  He made no attempt to look for the
"speaker, and that showed Kim that he knew."

â The pedigree of the white stallion is fully established.â 

â What proof is there?â  The Englishman switched at the rose-hedge in the
side of the drive.

â Mahbub Ali has given me this proof.â  Kim flipped the wad of folded
"paper into the air, and it fell in the path beside the man, who put his"
foot on it as a gardener came round the corner. When the servant passed
"he picked it up, dropped a rupeeâ Kim could hear the clinkâ and strode"
"into the house, never turning round. Swiftly Kim took up the money; but"
"for all his training, he was Irish enough by birth to reckon silver the"
least part of any game. What he desired was the visible effect of
"action; so, instead of slinking away, he lay close in the grass and"
wormed nearer to the house.

He sawâ Indian bungalows are open through and throughâ the Englishman
"return to a small dressing-room, in a comer of the veranda, that was"
"half office, littered with papers and despatch-boxes, and sit down to"
"study Mahbub Aliâ s message. His face, by the full ray of the kerosene"
"lamp, changed and darkened, and Kim, used as every beggar must be to"
"watching countenances, took good note."

"â Will! Will, dear!â  called a womanâ s voice. â You ought to be in the"
drawing-room. Theyâ ll be here in a minute.â 

The man still read intently.

"â Will!â  said the voice, five minutes later. â  Heâ s  come. I can hear"
the troopers in the drive.â 

The man dashed out bareheaded as a big landau with four native troopers
"behind it halted at the veranda, and a tall, black haired man, erect as"
"an arrow, swung out, preceded by a young officer who laughed"
pleasantly.

"Flat on his belly lay Kim, almost touching the high wheels. His man and"
the black stranger exchanged two sentences.

"â Certainly, sir,â  said the young officer promptly. â Everything waits"
while a horse is concerned.â 

"â We shanâ t be more than twenty minutes,â  said Kimâ s man. â You can do"
"the honoursâ keep â em amused, and all that.â "

"â Tell one of the troopers to wait,â  said the tall man, and they both"
passed into the dressing-room together as the landau rolled away. Kim
"saw their heads bent over Mahbub Aliâ s message, and heard the"
"voicesâ one low and deferential, the other sharp and decisive."

"â It isnâ t a question of weeks. It is a question of daysâ hours almost,â "
"said the elder. â Iâ d been expecting it for some time, but thisâ â he"
"tapped Mahbub Aliâ s paperâ â clinches it. Groganâ s dining here to-night,"
isnâ t he?â 

"â Yes, sir, and Macklin too.â "

â Very good. Iâ ll speak to them myself. The matter will be referred to
"the Council, of course, but this is a case where one is justified in"
assuming that we take action at once. Warn the Pined and Peshawar
"brigades. It will disorganize all the summer reliefs, but we canâ t help"
that. This comes of not smashing them thoroughly the first time. Eight
thousand should be enough.â 

"â What about artillery, sir?â "

â I must consult Macklin.â 

â Then it means war?â 

â No. Punishment. When a man is bound by the action of his predecessorâ â 

â But C25 may have lied.â 

"â He bears out the otherâ s information. Practically, they showed their"
hand six months back. But Devenish would have it there was a chance of
peace. Of course they used it to make themselves stronger. Send off
"those telegrams at onceâ the new code, not the oldâ mine and Whartonâ s. I"
donâ t think we need keep the ladies waiting any longer. We can settle
the rest over the cigars. I thought it was coming. Itâ s punishmentâ not
war.â 

"As the trooper cantered off, Kim crawled round to the back of the"
"house, where, going on his Lahore experiences, he judged there would be"
"foodâ and information. The kitchen was crowded with excited scullions,"
one of whom kicked him.

"â Aie,â  said Kim, feigning tears. â I came only to wash dishes in return"
for a bellyful.â 

â All Umballa is on the same errand. Get hence. They go in now with the
soup. Think you that we who serve Creighton Sahib need strange
scullions to help us through a big dinner?â 

"â It is a very big dinner,â  said Kim, looking at the plates."

â Small wonder. The guest of honour is none other than the Jang-i-Lat
Sahib [the Commander-in-Chief].â 

"â Ho!â  said Kim, with the correct guttural note of wonder. He had"
"learned what he wanted, and when the scullion turned he was gone."

"â And all that trouble,â  said he to himself, thinking as usual in"
"Hindustani, â for a horseâ s pedigree! Mahbub Ali should have come to me"
to learn a little lying. Every time before that I have borne a message
it concerned a woman. Now it is men. Better. The tall man said that
they will loose a great army to punish someoneâ somewhereâ the news goes
to Pindi and Peshawur. There are also guns. Would I had crept nearer.
It is big news!â 

He returned to find the cultivatorâ s cousinâ s younger brother
discussing the family law-suit in all its bearings with the cultivator
"and his wife and a few friends, while the lama dozed. After the evening"
meal some one passed him a water-pipe; and Kim felt very much of a man
"as he pulled at the smooth coconut-shell, his legs spread abroad in the"
"moonlight, his tongue clicking in remarks from time to time. His hosts"
were most polite; for the cultivatorâ s wife had told them of his vision
"of the Red Bull, and of his probable descent from another world."
"Moreover, the lama was a great and venerable curiosity."

"The family priest, an old, tolerant Sarsut Brahmin, dropped in later,"
and naturally started a theological argument to impress the family. By
"creed, of course, they were all on their priestâ s side, but the lama"
"was the guest and the novelty. His gentle kindliness, and his"
"impressive Chinese quotations, that sounded like spells, delighted them"
"hugely; and in this sympathetic, simple air, he expanded like the"
"Bodhisatâ s own lotus, speaking of his life in the great hills of"
"Such-zen, before, as he said, â I rose up to seek enlightenment.â "

Then it came out that in those worldly days he had been a master-hand
at casting horoscopes and nativities; and the family priest led him on
to describe his methods; each giving the planets names that the other
"could not understand, and pointing upwards as the big stars sailed"
across the dark. The children of the house tugged unrebuked at his
rosary; and he clean forgot the Rule which forbids looking at women as
"he talked of enduring snows, landslips, blocked passes, the remote"
"cliffs where men find sapphires and turquoise, and that wonderful"
upland road that leads at last into Great China itself.

â How thinkest thou of this one?â  said the cultivator aside to the
priest.

"â A holy manâ a holy man indeed. His Gods are not the Gods, but his feet"
"are upon the Way,â  was the answer. â And his methods of nativities,"
"though that is beyond thee, are wise and sure.â "

"â Tell me,â  said Kim lazily, â whether I find my Red Bull on a green"
"field, as was promised me.â "

"â What knowledge hast thou of thy birth-hour?â  the priest asked,"
swelling with importance.

â Between first and second cockcrow of the first night in May.â 

â Of what year?â 

â I do not know; but upon the hour that I cried first fell the great
earthquake in Srinagar which is in Kashmir.â  This Kim had from the
"woman who took care of him, and she again from Kimball Oâ Hara. The"
"earthquake had been felt in India, and for long stood a leading date in"
the Punjab.

â Ai!â  said a woman excitedly. This seemed to make Kimâ s supernatural
origin more certain. â Was not such an oneâ s daughter born thenâ â 

â And her mother bore her husband four sons in four years all likely
"boys,â  cried the cultivatorâ s wife, sitting outside the circle in the"
shadow.

"â None reared in the knowledge,â  said the family priest, â forget how the"
planets stood in their Houses upon that night.â  He began to draw in the
dust of the courtyard. â At least thou hast good claim to a half of the
House of the Bull. How runs thy prophecy?â 

"â Upon a day,â  said Kim, delighted at the sensation he was creating, â I"
"shall be made great by means of a Red Bull on a green field, but first"
there will enter two men making all things ready.â 

â Yes: thus ever at the opening of a vision. A thick darkness that
clears slowly; anon one enters with a broom making ready the place.
"Then begins the Sight. Two menâ thou sayest? Ay, ay. The Sun, leaving"
"the House of the Bull, enters that of the Twins. Hence the two men of"
"the prophecy. Let us now consider. Fetch me a twig, little one.â "

"He knitted his brows, scratched, smoothed out, and scratched again in"
"the dust mysterious signsâ to the wonder of all save the lama, who, with"
"fine instinct, forbore to interfere."

"At the end of half an hour, he tossed the twig from him with a grunt."

â Hm! Thus say the stars. Within three days come the two men to make all
things ready. After them follows the Bull; but the sign over against
him is the sign of War and armed men.â 

â There was indeed a man of the Ludhiana Sikhs in the carriage from
"Lahore,â  said the cultivatorâ s wife hopefully."

â Tck! Armed menâ many hundreds. What concern hast thou with war?â  said
the priest to Kim. â Thine is a red and an angry sign of War to be
loosed very soon.â 

â Noneâ none.â  said the lama earnestly. â We seek only peace and our
River.â 

"Kim smiled, remembering what he had overheard in the dressing-room."
Decidedly he was a favourite of the stars.

The priest brushed his foot over the rude horoscope. â More than this I
"cannot see. In three days comes the Bull to thee, boy.â "

"â And my River, my River,â  pleaded the lama. â I had hoped his Bull would"
lead us both to the River.â 

"â Alas, for that wondrous River, my brother,â  the priest replied. â Such"
things are not common.â 

"Next morning, though they were pressed to stay, the lama insisted on"
departure. They gave Kim a large bundle of good food and nearly three
"annas in copper money for the needs of the road, and with many"
blessings watched the two go southward in the dawn.

â Pity it is that these and such as these could not be freed fromâ â 

"â Nay, then would only evil people be left on the earth, and who would"
"give us meat and shelter?â  quoth Kim, stepping merrily under his"
burden.

"â Yonder is a small stream. Let us look,â  said the lama, and he led from"
the white road across the fields; walking into a very hornetsâ  nest of
pariah dogs.




CHAPTER III


"Yea, voice of every Soul that clung"
To life that strove from rung to rung
"When Devadattaâ s rule was young,"
The warm wind brings Kamakura.

Behind them an angry farmer brandished a bamboo pole. He was a
"market-gardener, Arain by caste, growing vegetables and flowers for"
"Umballa city, and well Kim knew the breed."

"â Such an one,â  said the lama, disregarding the dogs, â is impolite to"
"strangers, intemperate of speech and uncharitable. Be warned by his"
"demeanour, my disciple.â "

"â Ho, shameless beggars!â  shouted the farmer. â Begone! Get hence!â "

"â We go,â  the lama returned, with quiet dignity. â We go from these"
unblessed fields.â 

"â Ah,â  said Kim, sucking in his breath. â If the next crops fail, thou"
canst only blame thine own tongue.â 

The man shuffled uneasily in his slippers. â The land is full of
"beggars,â  he began, half apologetically."

"â And by what sign didst thou know that we would beg from thee, O Mali?â "
"said Kim tartly, using the name that a market-gardener least likes."
â All we sought was to look at that river beyond the field there.â 

"â River, forsooth!â  the man snorted. â What city do ye hail from not to"
"know a canal-cut? It runs as straight as an arrow, and I pay for the"
water as though it were molten silver. There is a branch of a river
beyond. But if ye need water I can give thatâ and milk.â 

"â Nay, we will go to the river,â  said the lama, striding out."

"â Milk and a meal.â  the man stammered, as he looked at the strange tall"
figure. â Iâ I would not draw evil upon myselfâ or my crops. But beggars
are so many in these hard days.â 

â Take notice.â  The lama turned to Kim. â He was led to speak harshly by
"the Red Mist of anger. That clearing from his eyes, he becomes"
courteous and of an affable heart. May his fields be blessed! Beware
"not to judge men too hastily, O farmer.â "

â I have met holy ones who would have cursed thee from hearthstone to
"byre,â  said Kim to the abashed man. â Is he not wise and holy? I am his"
disciple.â 

He cocked his nose in the air loftily and stepped across the narrow
field-borders with great dignity.

"â There is no pride,â  said the lama, after a pause, â there is no pride"
among such as follow the Middle Way.â 

â But thou hast said he was low-caste and discourteous.â 

"â Low-caste I did not say, for how can that be which is not? Afterwards"
"he amended his discourtesy, and I forgot the offence. Moreover, he is"
"as we are, bound upon the Wheel of Things; but he does not tread the"
"way of deliverance.â  He halted at a little runlet among the fields, and"
considered the hoof-pitted bank.

"â Now, how wilt thou know thy River?â  said Kim, squatting in the shade"
of some tall sugar-cane.

"â When I find it, an enlightenment will surely be given. This, I feel,"
"is not the place. O littlest among the waters, if only thou couldst"
tell me where runs my River! But be thou blessed to make the fields
bear!â 

â Look! Look!â  Kim sprang to his side and dragged him back. A
yellow-and-brown streak glided from the purple rustling stems to the
"bank, stretched its neck to the water, drank, and lay stillâ a big cobra"
"with fixed, lidless eyes."

"â I have no stickâ I have no stick,â  said Kim. â I will get me one and"
break his back.â 

â Why? He is upon the Wheel as we areâ a life ascending or
descendingâ very far from deliverance. Great evil must the soul have
done that is cast into this shape.â 

"â I hate all snakes,â  said Kim. No native training can quench the white"
manâ s horror of the Serpent.

â Let him live out his life.â  The coiled thing hissed and half opened
"its hood. â May thy release come soon, brother!â  the lama continued"
"placidly. â Hast  thou  knowledge, by chance, of my River?â "

"â Never have I seen such a man as thou art,â  Kim whispered, overwhelmed."
â Do the very snakes understand thy talk?â 

â Who knows?â  He passed within a foot of the cobraâ s poised head. It
flattened itself among the dusty coils.

"â Come, thou!â  he called over his shoulder."

"â Not I,â  said Kimâ . â I go round.â "

â Come. He does no hurt.â 

Kim hesitated for a moment. The lama backed his order by some droned
Chinese quotation which Kim took for a charm. He obeyed and bounded
"across the rivulet, and the snake, indeed, made no sign."

â Never have I seen such a man.â  Kim wiped the sweat from his forehead.
"â And now, whither go we?â "

"â That is for thee to say. I am old, and a strangerâ far from my own"
place. But that the  rÃªl -carriage fills my head with noises of
devil-drums I would go in it to Benares now ... Yet by so going we may
miss the River. Let us find another river.â 

Where the hard-worked soil gives three and even four crops a year
"through patches of sugar-cane, tobacco, long white radishes, and"
"nol-kol, all that day they strolled on, turning aside to every glimpse"
of water; rousing village dogs and sleeping villages at noonday; the
lama replying to the volleyed questions with an unswerving simplicity.
They sought a River: a River of miraculous healing. Had any one
knowledge of such a stream?

"Sometimes men laughed, but more often heard the story out to the end"
"and offered them a place in the shade, a drink of milk, and a meal. The"
"women were always kind, and the little children as children are the"
"world over, alternately shy and venturesome."

"Evening found them at rest under the village tree of a mud-walled,"
"mud-roofed hamlet, talking to the headman as the cattle came in from"
the grazing-grounds and the women prepared the dayâ s last meal. They
"had passed beyond the belt of market-gardens round hungry Umballa, and"
were among the mile-wide green of the staple crops.

"He was a white-bearded and affable elder, used to entertaining"
"strangers. He dragged out a string bedstead for the lama, set warm"
"cooked food before him, prepared him a pipe, and, the evening"
"ceremonies being finished in the village temple, sent for the village"
priest.

"Kim told the older children tales of the size and beauty of Lahore, of"
"railway travel, and such-like city things, while the men talked, slowly"
as their cattle chew the cud.

"â I cannot fathom it,â  said the headman at last to the priest. â How"
"readest thou this talk?â  The lama, his tale told, was silently telling"
his beads.

â He is a Seeker.â  the priest answered. â The land is full of such.
"Remember him who came only last, monthâ the  faquir  with the tortoise?â "

"â Ay, but that man had right and reason, for Krishna Himself appeared in"
a vision promising him Paradise without the burning-pyre if he
journeyed to Prayag. This man seeks no God who is within my knowledge.â 

"â Peace, he is old: he comes from far off, and he is mad,â  the"
smooth-shaven priest replied. â Hear me.â  He turned to the lama. â Three
 kos  (six miles) to the westward runs the great road to Calcutta.â 

â But I would go to Benaresâ to Benares.â 

â And to Benares also. It crosses all streams on this side of Hind. Now
"my word to thee, Holy One, is rest here till tomorrow. Then take the"
roadâ  (it was the Grand Trunk Road he meant) â and test each stream that
"it overpasses; for, as I understand, the virtue of thy River lies"
"neither in one pool nor place, but throughout its length. Then, if thy"
"Gods will, be assured that thou wilt come upon thy freedom.â "

â That is well said.â  The lama was much impressed by the plan. â We will
"begin tomorrow, and a blessing on thee for showing old feet such a near"
"road.â  A deep, sing-song Chinese half-chant closed the sentence. Even"
"the priest was impressed, and the headman feared an evil spell: but"
"none could look at the lamaâ s simple, eager face and doubt him long."

"â Seest thou my  chela? â  he said, diving into his snuff-gourd with an"
important sniff. It was his duty to repay courtesy with courtesy.

â I seeâ and hear.â  The headman rolled his eye where Kim was chatting to
a girl in blue as she laid crackling thorns on a fire.

"â He also has a Search of his own. No river, but a Bull. Yea, a Red Bull"
"on a green field will some day raise him to honour. He is, I think, not"
altogether of this world. He was sent of a sudden to aid me in this
"search, and his name is Friend of all the World.â "

"The priest smiled. â Ho, there, Friend of all the World,â  he cried"
"across the sharp-smelling smoke, â what art thou?â "

"â This Holy Oneâ s disciple,â  said Kim."

â He says thou are a  bÅ«t  (a spirit).â 

"â Can  bÅ«ts  eat?â  said Kim, with a twinkle. â For I am hungry.â "

"â It is no jest,â  cried the lama. â A certain astrologer of that city"
whose name I have forgottenâ â 

"â That is no more than the city of Umballa where we slept last night,â "
Kim whispered to the priest.

"â Ay, Umballa was it? He cast a horoscope and declared that my  chela "
should find his desire within two days. But what said he of the meaning
"of the stars, Friend of all the World?â "

Kim cleared his throat and looked around at the village greybeards.

"â The meaning of my Star is War,â  he replied pompously."

Somebody laughed at the little tattered figure strutting on the
brickwork plinth under the great tree. Where a native would have lain
"down, Kimâ s white blood set him upon his feet."

"â Ay, War,â  he answered."

"â That is a sure prophecy,â  rumbled a deep voice. â For there is always"
war along the Borderâ as I know.â 

"It was an old, withered man, who had served the Government in the days"
of the Mutiny as a native officer in a newly raised cavalry regiment.
"The Government had given him a good holding in the village, and though"
"the demands of his sons, now grey-bearded officers on their own"
"account, had impoverished him, he was still a person of consequence."
English officialsâ Deputy Commissioners evenâ turned aside from the main
"road to visit him, and on those occasions he dressed himself in the"
"uniform of ancient days, and stood up like a ramrod."

â But this shall be a great warâ a war of eight thousand.â  Kimâ s voice
"shrilled across the quick-gathering crowd, astonishing himself."

"â Redcoats or our own regiments?â  the old man snapped, as though he were"
asking an equal. His tone made men respect Kim.

"â Redcoats,â  said Kim at a venture. â Redcoats and guns.â "

"â Butâ but the astrologer said no word of this,â  cried the lama, snuffing"
prodigiously in his excitement.

"â But  I  know. The word has come to me, who am this Holy Oneâ s"
disciple. There will rise a warâ a war of eight thousand redcoats. From
Pindi and Peshawur they will be drawn. This is sure.â 

"â The boy has heard bazar-talk,â  said the priest."

"â But he was always by my side,â  said the lama. â How should he know? I"
did not know.â 

"â He will make a clever juggler when the old man is dead,â  muttered the"
priest to the headman. â What new trick is this?â 

"â A sign. Give me a sign,â  thundered the old soldier suddenly. â If there"
were war my sons would have told me.â 

"â When all is ready, thy sons, doubt not, will be told. But it is a long"
road from thy sons to the man in whose hands these things lie.â  Kim
"warmed to the game, for it reminded him of experiences in the"
"letter-carrying line, when, for the sake of a few pice, he pretended to"
know more than he knew. But now he was playing for larger thingsâ the
sheer excitement and the sense of power. He drew a new breath and went
on.

"â Old man, give  me  a sign. Do underlings order the goings of eight"
thousand redcoatsâ with guns?â 

â No.â  Still the old man answered as though Kim were an equal.

"â Dost thou know who He is, then, that gives the order?â "

â I have seen Him.â 

â To know again?â 

â I have known Him since he was a lieutenant in the  top-khana  (the
Artillery).â 

"â A tall man. A tall man with black hair, walking thus?â  Kim took a few"
"paces in a stiff, wooden style."

â Ay. But that anyone may have seen.â  The crowd were breathlessâ still
through all this talk.

"â That is true,â  said Kim. â But I will say more. Look now. First the"
great man walks thus. Then He thinks thus.â  (Kim drew a forefinger over
his forehead and downwards till it came to rest by the angle of the
jaw.) â Anon He twitches his fingers thus. Anon He thrusts his hat under
his left armpit.â  Kim illustrated the motion and stood like a stork.

"The old man groaned, inarticulate with amazement; and the crowd"
shivered.

â Soâ soâ so. But what does He when He is about to give an order?â 

â He rubs the skin at the back of his neckâ thus. Then falls one finger
on the table and He makes a small sniffing noise through his nose. Then
"He speaks, saying: â€˜Loose such and such a regiment. Call out such"
guns.â â 

The old man rose stiffly and saluted.

â â€˜Forâ â â Kim translated into the vernacular the clinching sentences he
"had heard in the dressing-room at Umballaâ â â€˜For,â  says He, â€˜we should"
have done this long ago. It is not warâ it is a chastisement. Snff!â â 

â Enough. I believe. I have seen Him thus in the smoke of battles. Seen
and heard. It is He!â 

â I saw no smokeâ â Kimâ s voice shifted to the rapt sing-song of the
wayside fortune-teller. â I saw this in darkness. First came a man to
make things clear. Then came horsemen. Then came He standing in a ring
"of light. The rest followed as I have said. Old man, have I spoken"
truth?â 

â It is He. Past all doubt it is He.â 

"The crowd drew a long, quavering breath, staring alternately at the old"
"man, still at attention, and ragged Kim against the purple twilight."

â Said I notâ said I not he was from the other world?â  cried the lama
proudly. â He is the Friend of all the World. He is the Friend of the
Stars!â 

"â At least it does not concern us,â  a man cried. â O thou young"
"soothsayer, if the gift abides with thee at all seasons, I have a"
red-spotted cow. She may be sister to thy Bull for aught I knowâ â 

"â Or I care,â  said Kim. â My Stars do not concern themselves with thy"
cattle.â 

"â Nay, but she is very sick,â  a woman struck in. â My man is a buffalo,"
or he would have chosen his words better. Tell me if she recover?â 

"Had Kim been at all an ordinary boy, he would have carried on the play;"
"but one does not know Lahore city, and least of all the  faquirs  by"
"the Taksali Gate, for thirteen years without also knowing human nature."

"The priest looked at him sideways, something bitterlyâ a dry and"
blighting smile.

"â Is there no priest, then, in the village? I thought I had seen a great"
"one even now,â  cried Kim."

â Ayâ butâ â  the woman began.

â But thou and thy husband hoped to get the cow cured for a handful of
thanks.â  The shot told: they were notoriously the closest-fisted couple
in the village. â It is not well to cheat the temples. Give a young calf
"to thine own priest, and, unless thy Gods are angry past recall, she"
will give milk within a month.â 

"â A master-beggar art thou,â  purred the priest approvingly. â Not the"
cunning of forty years could have done better. Surely thou hast made
the old man rich?â 

"â A little flour, a little butter and a mouthful of cardamoms,â  Kim"
"retorted, flushed with the praise, but still cautiousâ â Does one grow"
"rich on that? And, as thou canst see, he is mad. But it serves me while"
I learn the road at least.â 

He knew what the  faquirs  of the Taksali Gate were like when they
"talked among themselves, and copied the very inflection of their lewd"
disciples.

"â Is his Search, then, truth or a cloak to other ends? It may be"
treasure.â 

â He is madâ many times mad. There is nothing else.â 

Here the old soldier bobbled up and asked if Kim would accept his
"hospitality for the night. The priest recommended him to do so, but"
insisted that the honour of entertaining the lama belonged to the
templeâ at which the lama smiled guilelessly. Kim glanced from one face
"to the other, and drew his own conclusions."

"â Where is the money?â  he whispered, beckoning the old man off into the"
darkness.

â In my bosom. Where else?â 

â Give it me. Quietly and swiftly give it me.â 

â But why? Here is no ticket to buy.â 

"â Am I thy  chela , or am I not? Do I not safeguard thy old feet about"
the ways? Give me the money and at dawn I will return it.â  He slipped
his hand above the lamaâ s girdle and brought away the purse.

â Be it soâ be it so.â  The old man nodded his head. â This is a great and
terrible world. I never knew there were so many men alive in it.â 

"Next morning the priest was in a very bad temper, but the lama was"
quite happy; and Kim had enjoyed a most interesting evening with the
"old man, who brought out his cavalry sabre and, balancing it on his dry"
"knees, told tales of the Mutiny and young captains thirty years in"
"their graves, till Kim dropped off to sleep."

"â Certainly the air of this country is good,â  said the lama. â I sleep"
"lightly, as do all old men; but last night I slept unwaking till broad"
day. Even now I am heavy.â 

"â Drink a draught of hot milk,â  said Kim, who had carried not a few such"
remedies to opium-smokers of his acquaintance. â It is time to take the
Road again.â 

"â The long Road that overpasses all the rivers of Hind,â  said the lama"
"gaily. â Let us go. But how thinkest thou,  chela , to recompense these"
"people, and especially the priest, for their great kindness? Truly they"
"are  bÅ«t-parast , but in other lives, maybe, they will receive"
enlightenment. A rupee to the temple? The thing within is no more than
"stone and red paint, but the heart of man we must acknowledge when and"
where it is good.â 

"â Holy One, hast thou ever taken the Road alone?â  Kim looked up sharply,"
like the Indian crows so busy about the fields.

"â Surely, child: from Kulu to PathÃ¢nkotâ from Kulu, where my first"
" chela  died. When men were kind to us we made offerings, and all men"
were well-disposed throughout all the Hills.â 

"â It is otherwise in Hind,â  said Kim drily. â Their Gods are many-armed"
and malignant. Let them alone.â 

"â I would set thee on thy road for a little, Friend of all the World,"
"thou and thy yellow man.â  The old soldier ambled up the village street,"
"all shadowy in the dawn, on a punt, scissor-hocked pony. â Last night"
"broke up the fountains of remembrance in my so-dried heart, and it was"
as a blessing to me. Truly there is war abroad in the air. I smell it.
See! I have brought my sword.â 

"He sat long-legged on the little beast, with the big sword at his"
sideâ hand dropped on the pommelâ staring fiercely over the flat lands
towards the North. â Tell me again how He showed in thy vision. Come up
and sit behind me. The beast will carry two.â 

"â I am this Holy Oneâ s disciple,â  said Kim, as they cleared the"
"village-gate. The villagers seemed almost sorry to be rid of them, but"
the priestâ s farewell was cold and distant. He had wasted some opium on
a man who carried no money.

"â That is well spoken. I am not much used to holy men, but respect is"
always good. There is no respect in these daysâ not even when a
Commissioner Sahib comes to see me. But why should one whose Star leads
him to war follow a holy man?â 

"â But he  is  a holy man,â  said Kim earnestly. â In truth, and in talk"
"and in act, holy. He is not like the others. I have never seen such an"
"one. We be not fortune-tellers, or jugglers, or beggars.â "

â Thou art not. That I can see. But I do not know that other. He marches
"well, though.â "

"The first freshness of the day carried the lama forward with long,"
"easy, camel-like strides. He was deep in meditation, mechanically"
clicking his rosary.

They followed the rutted and worn country road that wound across the
"flat between the great dark-green mango-groves, the line of the"
snowcapped Himalayas faint to the eastward. All India was at work in
"the fields, to the creaking of well-wheels, the shouting of ploughmen"
"behind their cattle, and the clamour of the crows. Even the pony felt"
the good influence and almost broke into a trot as Kim laid a hand on
the stirrup-leather.

"â It repents me that I did not give a rupee to the shrine,â  said the"
lama on the last bead of his eighty-one.

"The old soldier growled in his beard, so that the lama for the first"
time was aware of him.

"â Seekest thou the River also?â  said he, turning."

"â The day is new,â  was the reply. â What need of a river save to water at"
before sundown? I come to show thee a short lane to the Big Road.â 

"â That is a courtesy to be remembered, O man of good will. But why the"
sword?â 

The old soldier looked as abashed as a child interrupted in his game of
make-believe.

"â The sword,â  he said, fumbling it. â Oh, that was a fancy of mine an old"
manâ s fancy. Truly the police orders are that no man must bear weapons
"throughout Hind, butâ â he cheered up and slapped the hiltâ â all the"
constabeels hereabout know me.â 

"â It is not a good fancy,â  said the lama. â What profit to kill men?â "

â Very littleâ as I know; but if evil men were not now and then slain it
would not be a good world for weaponless dreamers. I do not speak
without knowledge who have seen the land from Delhi south awash with
blood.â 

"â What madness was that, then?â "

"â The Gods, who sent it for a plague, alone know. A madness ate into all"
"the Army, and they turned against their officers. That was the first"
"evil, but not past remedy if they had then held their hands. But they"
chose to kill the Sahibsâ  wives and children. Then came the Sahibs from
over the sea and called them to most strict account.â 

"â Some such rumour, I believe, reached me once long ago. They called it"
"the Black Year, as I remember.â "

"â What manner of life hast thou led, not to know The Year? A rumour"
"indeed! All earth knew, and trembled!â "

â Our earth never shook but onceâ upon the day that the Excellent One
received Enlightenment.â 

â Umph! I saw Delhi shake at leastâ and Delhi is the navel of the world.â 

"â So they turned against women and children? That was a bad deed, for"
which the punishment cannot be avoided.â 

"â Many strove to do so, but with very small profit. I was then in a"
regiment of cavalry. It broke. Of six hundred and eighty sabres stood
"fast to their saltâ how many, think you? Three. Of whom I was one.â "

â The greater merit.â 

"â Merit! We did not consider it merit in those days. My people, my"
"friends, my brothers fell from me. They said: â€˜The time of the English"
is accomplished. Let each strike out a little holding for himself.â  But
"I had talked with the men of Sobraon, of Chilianwallah, of Moodkee and"
Ferozeshah. I said: â€˜Abide a little and the wind turns. There is no
blessing in this work.â  In those days I rode seventy miles with an
English Memsahib and her babe on my saddle-bow. (Wow! That was a horse
"fit for a man!) I placed them in safety, and back came I to my"
"officerâ the one that was not killed of our five. â€˜Give me work,â  said"
"I, â€˜for I am an outcast among my own kind, and my cousinâ s blood is wet"
"on my sabre.â  â€˜Be content,â  said he. â€˜There is great work forward. When"
this madness is over there is a recompense.â â 

"â Ay, there is a recompense when the madness is over, surely?â  the lama"
muttered half to himself.

â They did not hang medals in those days on all who by accident had
heard a gun fired. No! In nineteen pitched battles was I; in
six-and-forty skirmishes of horse; and in small affairs without number.
"Nine wounds I bear; a medal and four clasps and the medal of an Order,"
"for my captains, who are now generals, remembered me when the"
"Kaisar-i-Hind had accomplished fifty years of her reign, and all the"
land rejoiced. They said: â€˜Give him the Order of Berittish India.â  I
carry it upon my neck now. I have also my  jaghir  (holding) from the
hands of the Stateâ a free gift to me and mine. The men of the old
daysâ they are now Commissionersâ come riding to me through the
cropsâ high upon horses so that all the village seesâ and we talk out the
"old skirmishes, one dead manâ s name leading to another.â "

â And after?â  said the lama.

"â Oh, afterwards they go away, but not before my village has seen.â "

â And at the last what wilt thou do?â 

â At the last I shall die.â 

â And after?â 

â Let the Gods order it. I have never pestered Them with prayers. I do
"not think They will pester me. Look you, I have noticed in my long life"
that those who eternally break in upon Those Above with complaints and
"reports and bellowings and weepings are presently sent for in haste, as"
our Colonel used to send for slack-jawed down-country men who talked
"too much. No, I have never wearied the Gods. They will remember this,"
"and give me a quiet place where I can drive my lance in the shade, and"
wait to welcome my sons: I have no less than three Rissaldarâ majors
allâ in the regiments.â 

"â And they likewise, bound upon the Wheel, go forth from life to"
"lifeâ from despair to despair,â  said the lama below his breath, â hot,"
"uneasy, snatching.â "

"â Ay,â  the old soldier chuckled. â Three Rissaldarâ majors in three"
"regiments. Gamblers a little, but so am I. They must be well mounted;"
"and one cannot take the horses as in the old days one took women. Well,"
"well, my holding can pay for all. How thinkest thou? It is a"
"well-watered strip, but my men cheat me. I do not know how to ask save"
"at the lanceâ s point. Ugh! I grow angry and I curse them, and they"
"feign penitence, but behind my back I know they call me a toothless old"
ape.â 

â Hast thou never desired any other thing?â 

â Yesâ yesâ a thousand times! A straight back and a close-clinging knee
once more; a quick wrist and a keen eye; and the marrow that makes a
"man. Oh, the old daysâ the good days of my strength!â "

â That strength is weakness.â 

â It has turned so; but fifty years since I could have proved it
"otherwise,â  the old soldier retorted, driving his stirrup-edge into the"
ponyâ s lean flank.

â But I know a River of great healing.â 

â I have drank Gunga-water to the edge of dropsy. All she gave me was a
"flux, and no sort of strength.â "

â It is not Gunga. The River that I know washes from all taint of sin.
Ascending the far bank one is assured of Freedom. I do not know thy
"life, but thy face is the face of the honourable and courteous. Thou"
"hast clung to thy Way, rendering fidelity when it was hard to give, in"
that Black Year of which I now remember other tales. Enter now upon the
"Middle Way which is the path to Freedom. Hear the Most Excellent Law,"
and do not follow dreams.â 

"â Speak, then, old man,â  the soldier smiled, half saluting. â We be all"
babblers at our age.â 

"The lama squatted under the shade of a mango, whose shadow played"
checkerwise over his face; the soldier sat stiffly on the pony; and
"Kim, making sure that there were no snakes, lay down in the crotch of"
the twisted roots.

"There was a drowsy buzz of small life in hot sunshine, a cooing of"
"doves, and a sleepy drone of well-wheels across the fields. Slowly and"
impressively the lama began. At the end of ten minutes the old soldier
"slid from his pony, to hear better as he said, and sat with the reins"
"round his wrist. The lamaâ s voice faltered, the periods lengthened. Kim"
was busy watching a grey squirrel. When the little scolding bunch of
"fur, close pressed to the branch, disappeared, preacher and audience"
"were fast asleep, the old officerâ s strong-cut head pillowed on his"
"arm, the lamaâ s thrown back against the tree-bole, where it showed like"
"yellow ivory. A naked child toddled up, stared, and, moved by some"
"quick impulse of reverence, made a solemn little obeisance before the"
"lamaâ only the child was so short and fat that it toppled over sideways,"
"and Kim laughed at the sprawling, chubby legs. The child, scared and"
"indignant, yelled aloud."

"â Hai! Hai!â  said the soldier, leaping to his feet. â What is it? What"
orders? ... It is ... a child! I dreamed it was an alarm. Little
oneâ little oneâ do not cry. Have I slept? That was discourteous indeed!â 

â I fear! I am afraid!â  roared the child.

â What is it to fear? Two old men and a boy? How wilt thou ever make a
"soldier, Princeling?â "

"The lama had waked too, but, taking no direct notice of the child,"
clicked his rosary.

"â What is that?â  said the child, stopping a yell midway. â I have never"
seen such things. Give them me.â 

"â Aha.â  said the lama, smiling, and trailing a loop of it on the grass:"

"This is a handful of cardamoms, This is a lump of  ghi: "
"This is millet and chillies and rice, A supper for thee and me!"

"The child shrieked with joy, and snatched at the dark, glancing beads."

"â Oho!â  said the old soldier. â Whence hadst thou that song, despiser of"
this world?â 

"â I learned it in PathÃ¢nkotâ sitting on a doorstep,â  said the lama shyly."
â It is good to be kind to babes.â 

"â As I remember, before the sleep came on us, thou hadst told me that"
"marriage and bearing were darkeners of the true light, stumbling-blocks"
upon the Way. Do children drop from Heaven in thy country? Is it the
Way to sing them songs?â 

"â No man is all perfect,â  said the lama gravely, recoiling the rosary."
"â Run now to thy mother, little one.â "

â Hear him!â  said the soldier to Kim. â He is ashamed for that he has
"made a child happy. There was a very good householder lost in thee, my"
"brother. Hai, child!â  He threw it a pice. â Sweetmeats are always"
sweet.â  And as the little figure capered away into the sunshine: â They
"grow up and become men. Holy One, I grieve that I slept in the midst of"
thy preaching. Forgive me.â 

"â We be two old men,â  said the lama. â The fault is mine. I listened to"
"thy talk of the world and its madness, and one fault led to the next.â "

â Hear him! What harm do thy Gods suffer from play with a babe? And that
song was very well sung. Let us go on and I will sing thee the song of
Nikal Seyn before Delhiâ the old song.â 

"And they fared out from the gloom of the mango-tope, the old manâ s"
"high, shrill voice ringing across the field, as wail by long-drawn wail"
he unfolded the story of Nikal Seyn [Nicholson]â the song that men sing
"in the Punjab to this day. Kim was delighted, and the lama listened"
with deep interest.

"â  Ahi! Nikal Seyn is deadâ he died before Delhi! Lances of the North,"
"take vengeance for Nikal Seyn .â  He quavered it out to the end, marking"
the trills with the flat of his sword on the ponyâ s rump.

"â And now we come to the Big Road,â  said he, after receiving the"
compliments of Kim; for the lama was markedly silent. â It is long since
"I have ridden this way, but thy boyâ s talk stirred me. See, Holy"
Oneâ the Great Road which is the backbone of all Hind. For the most part
"it is shaded, as here, with four lines of trees; the middle roadâ all"
hardâ takes the quick traffic. In the days before rail-carriages the
Sahibs travelled up and down here in hundreds. Now there are only
country-carts and such like. Left and right is the rougher road for the
"heavy cartsâ grain and cotton and timber, fodder, lime and hides. A man"
goes in safety here for at every few  kos  is a police-station. The
police are thieves and extortioners (I myself would patrol it with
"cavalryâ young recruits under a strong captain), but at least they do"
not suffer any rivals. All castes and kinds of men move here.

"â Look! Brahmins and chumars, bankers and tinkers, barbers and bunnias,"
pilgrims and pottersâ all the world going and coming. It is to me as a
river from which I am withdrawn like a log after a flood.â 

And truly the Grand Trunk Road is a wonderful spectacle. It runs
"straight, bearing without crowding Indiaâ s traffic for fifteen hundred"
milesâ such a river of life as nowhere else exists in the world. They
"looked at the green-arched, shade-flecked length of it, the white"
breadth speckled with slow-pacing folk; and the two-roomed
police-station opposite.

"â Who bears arms against the law?â  a constable called out laughingly, as"
he caught sight of the soldierâ s sword. â Are not the police enough to
destroy evil-doers?â 

"â It was because of the police I bought it,â  was the answer. â Does all"
go well in Hind?â 

"â Rissaldar Sahib, all goes well.â "

"â I am like an old tortoise, look you, who puts his head out from the"
"bank and draws it in again. Ay, this is the Road of Hindustan. All men"
come by this way...â 

"â Son of a swine, is the soft part of the road meant for thee to scratch"
thy back upon? Father of all the daughters of shame and husband of ten
"thousand virtueless ones, thy mother was devoted to a devil, being led"
thereto by her mother. Thy aunts have never had a nose for seven
generations! Thy sisterâ What Owlâ s folly told thee to draw thy carts
across the road? A broken wheel? Then take a broken head and put the
two together at leisure!â 

The voice and a venomous whip-cracking came out of a pillar of dust
"fifty yards away, where a cart had broken down. A thin, high Kathiawar"
"mare, with eyes and nostrils aflame, rocketed out of the jam, snorting"
and wincing as her rider bent her across the road in chase of a
"shouting man. He was tall and grey-bearded, sitting the almost mad"
"beast as a piece of her, and scientifically lashing his victim between"
plunges.

"The old manâ s face lit with pride. â My child!â  said he briefly, and"
strove to rein the ponyâ s neck to a fitting arch.

â Am I to be beaten before the police?â  cried the carter. â Justice! I
will have Justiceâ â 

â Am I to be blocked by a shouting ape who upsets ten thousand sacks
under a young horseâ s nose? That is the way to ruin a mare.â 

"â He speaks truth. He speaks truth. But she follows her man close,â  said"
the old man. The carter ran under the wheels of his cart and thence
threatened all sorts of vengeance.

"â They are strong men, thy sons,â  said the policeman serenely, picking"
his teeth.

The horseman delivered one last vicious cut with his whip and came on
at a canter.

â My father!â  He reigned back ten yards and dismounted.

"The old man was off his pony in an instant, and they embraced as do"
father and son in the East.




CHAPTER IV


"Good Luck, she is never a lady,"
"But the cursedest quean alive,"
"Tricksy, wincing, and jadyâ "
Kittle to lead or drive.
Greet herâ sheâ s hailing a stranger!
Meet herâ sheâ s busking to leave!
Let her alone for a shrew to the bone
And the hussy comes plucking your sleeve!
"Largesse! Largesse, O Fortune!"
Give or hold at your will.
"If Iâ ve no care for Fortune,"
Fortune must follow me still!

 The Wishing-Caps .

"Then, lowering their voices, they spoke together. Kim came to rest"
"under a tree, but the lama tugged impatiently at his elbow."

â Let us go on. The River is not here.â 

â Hai mai! Have we not walked enough for a little? Our River will not
"run away. Patience, and he will give us a dole.â "

"â This.â  said the old soldier suddenly, â is the Friend of the Stars. He"
"brought me the news yesterday. Having seen the very man Himself, in a"
"vision, giving orders for the war.â "

"â Hm!â  said his son, all deep in his broad chest. â He came by a"
bazar-rumour and made profit of it.â 

His father laughed. â At least he did not ride to me begging for a new
"charger, and the Gods know how many rupees. Are thy brothersâ  regiments"
also under orders?â 

â I do not know. I took leave and came swiftly to thee in caseâ â 

â In case they ran before thee to beg. O gamblers and spendthrifts all!
But thou hast never yet ridden in a charge. A good horse is needed
"there, truly. A good follower and a good pony also for the marching."
Let us seeâ let us see.â  He thrummed on the pommel.

"â This is no place to cast accounts in, my father. Let us go to thy"
house.â 

"â At least pay the boy, then: I have no pice with me, and he brought"
"auspicious news. Ho! Friend of all the World, a war is toward as thou"
hast said.â 

"â Nay, as I know,  the  war,â  returned Kim composedly."

"â Eh?â  said the lama, fingering his beads, all eager for the road."

â My master does not trouble the Stars for hire. We brought the news
"bear witness, we brought the news, and now we go.â  Kim half-crooked his"
hand at his side.

"The son tossed a silver coin through the sunlight, grumbling something"
"about beggars and jugglers. It was a four-anna piece, and would feed"
"them well for days. The lama, seeing the flash of the metal, droned a"
blessing.

"â Go thy way, Friend of all the World,â  piped the old soldier, wheeling"
his scrawny mount. â For once in all my days I have met a true
prophetâ who was not in the Army.â 

Father and son swung round together: the old man sitting as erect as
the younger.

A Punjabi constable in yellow linen trousers slouched across the road.
He had seen the money pass.

â Halt!â  he cried in impressive English. â Know ye not that there is a
" takkus  of two annas a head, which is four annas, on those who enter"
"the Road from this side-road? It is the order of the Sirkar, and the"
money is spent for the planting of trees and the beautification of the
ways.â 

"â And the bellies of the police,â  said Kim, slipping out of armâ s reach."
"â Consider for a while, man with a mud head. Think you we came from the"
"nearest pond like the frog, thy father-in-law? Hast thou ever heard the"
name of thy brother?â 

"â And who was he? Leave the boy alone,â  cried a senior constable,"
"immensely delighted, as he squatted down to smoke his pipe in the"
veranda.

"â He took a label from a bottle of  belaitee-pani  (soda-water), and,"
"affixing it to a bridge, collected taxes for a month from those who"
"passed, saying that it was the Sirkarâ s order. Then came an Englishman"
"and broke his head. Ah, brother, I am a town-crow, not a village-crow!â "

"The policeman drew back abashed, and Kim hooted at him all down the"
road.

â Was there ever such a disciple as I?â  he cried merrily to the lama.
â All earth would have picked thy bones within ten mile of Lahore city
if I had not guarded thee.â 

"â I consider in my own mind whether thou art a spirit, sometimes, or"
"sometimes an evil imp,â  said the lama, smiling slowly."

â I am thy  chela .â  Kim dropped into step at his sideâ that
indescribable gait of the long-distance tramp all the world over.

"â Now let us walk,â  muttered the lama, and to the click of his rosary"
"they walked in silence mile upon mile. The lama as usual, was deep in"
"meditation, but Kimâ s bright eyes were open wide. This broad, smiling"
"river of life, he considered, was a vast improvement on the cramped and"
crowded Lahore streets. There were new people and new sights at every
strideâ castes he knew and castes that were altogether out of his
experience.

"They met a troop of long-haired, strong-scented Sansis with baskets of"
"lizards and other unclean food on their backs, their lean dogs sniffing"
"at their heels. These people kept their own side of the road, moving at"
"a quick, furtive jog-trot, and all other castes gave them ample room;"
"for the Sansi is deep pollution. Behind them, walking wide and stiffly"
"across the strong shadows, the memory of his leg-irons still on him,"
strode one newly released from the jail; his full stomach and shiny
skin to prove that the Government fed its prisoners better than most
"honest men could feed themselves. Kim knew that walk well, and made"
"broad jest of it as they passed. Then an Akali, a wild-eyed,"
"wild-haired Sikh devotee in the blue-checked clothes of his faith, with"
"polished-steel quoits glistening on the cone of his tall blue turban,"
"stalked past, returning from a visit to one of the independent Sikh"
"States, where he had been singing the ancient glories of the Khalsa to"
College-trained princelings in top-boots and white-cord breeches. Kim
was careful not to irritate that man; for the Akaliâ s temper is short
and his arm quick. Here and there they met or were overtaken by the
gaily dressed crowds of whole villages turning out to some local fair;
"the women, with their babes on their hips, walking behind the men, the"
"older boys prancing on sticks of sugar-cane, dragging rude brass models"
"of locomotives such as they sell for a halfpenny, or flashing the sun"
into the eyes of their betters from cheap toy mirrors. One could see at
a glance what each had bought; and if there were any doubt it needed
"only to watch the wives comparing, brown arm against brown arm, the"
newly purchased dull glass bracelets that come from the North-West.
"These merry-makers stepped slowly, calling one to the other and"
"stopping to haggle with sweetmeat-sellers, or to make a prayer before"
"one of the wayside shrinesâ sometimes Hindu, sometimes Mussalmanâ which"
the low-caste of both creeds share with beautiful impartiality. A solid
"line of blue, rising and falling like the back of a caterpillar in"
"haste, would swing up through the quivering dust and trot past to a"
chorus of quick cackling. That was a gang of  changars â the women who
have taken all the embankments of all the Northern railways under their
"chargeâ a flat-footed, big-bosomed, strong-limbed, blue-petticoated clan"
"of earth-carriers, hurrying north on news of a job, and wasting no time"
"by the road. They belong to the caste whose men do not count, and they"
"walked with squared elbows, swinging hips, and heads on high, as suits"
women who carry heavy weights. A little later a marriage procession
"would strike into the Grand Trunk with music and shoutings, and a smell"
of marigold and jasmine stronger even than the reek of the dust. One
"could see the brideâ s litter, a blur of red and tinsel, staggering"
"through the haze, while the bridegroomâ s bewreathed pony turned aside"
to snatch a mouthful from a passing fodder-cart. Then Kim would join
"the Kentish-fire of good wishes and bad jokes, wishing the couple a"
"hundred sons and no daughters, as the saying is. Still more interesting"
and more to be shouted over it was when a strolling juggler with some
"half-trained monkeys, or a panting, feeble bear, or a woman who tied"
"goatsâ  horns to her feet, and with these danced on a slack-rope, set"
"the horses to shying and the women to shrill, long-drawn quavers of"
amazement.

The lama never raised his eyes. He did not note the money-lender on his
"goose-rumped pony, hastening along to collect the cruel interest; or"
"the long-shouting, deep-voiced little mobâ still in military"
"formationâ of native soldiers on leave, rejoicing to be rid of their"
"breeches and puttees, and saying the most outrageous things to the most"
respectable women in sight. Even the seller of Ganges-water he did not
"see, and Kim expected that he would at least buy a bottle of that"
"precious stuff. He looked steadily at the ground, and strode as"
"steadily hour after hour, his soul busied elsewhere. But Kim was in the"
seventh heaven of joy. The Grand Trunk at this point was built on an
"embankment to guard against winter floods from the foothills, so that"
"one walked, as it were, a little above the country, along a stately"
"corridor, seeing all India spread out to left and right. It was"
beautiful to behold the many-yoked grain and cotton wagons crawling
"over the country roads: one could hear their axles, complaining a mile"
"away, coming nearer, till with shouts and yells and bad words they"
"climbed up the steep incline and plunged on to the hard main road,"
"carter reviling carter. It was equally beautiful to watch the people,"
"little clumps of red and blue and pink and white and saffron, turning"
"aside to go to their own villages, dispersing and growing small by twos"
"and threes across the level plain. Kim felt these things, though he"
"could not give tongue to his feelings, and so contented himself with"
buying peeled sugar-cane and spitting the pith generously about his
"path. From time to time the lama took snuff, and at last Kim could"
endure the silence no longer.

â This is a good landâ the land of the South!â  said he. â The air is good;
the water is good. Eh?â 

"â And they are all bound upon the Wheel,â  said the lama. â Bound from"
life after life. To none of these has the Way been shown.â  He shook
himself back to this world.

"â And now we have walked a weary way,â  said Kim. â Surely we shall soon"
"come to a  parao  (a resting-place). Shall we stay there? Look, the sun"
is sloping.â 

â Who will receive us this evening?â 

â That is all one. This country is full of good folk. Besidesâ  he sunk
his voice beneath a whisperâ â we have money.â 

The crowd thickened as they neared the resting-place which marked the
end of their dayâ s journey. A line of stalls selling very simple food
"and tobacco, a stack of firewood, a police-station, a well, a"
"horse-trough, a few trees, and, under them, some trampled ground dotted"
"with the black ashes of old fires, are all that mark a  parao  on the"
Grand Trunk; if you except the beggars and the crowsâ both hungry.

By this time the sun was driving broad golden spokes through the lower
branches of the mango-trees; the parakeets and doves were coming home
"in their hundreds; the chattering, grey-backed Seven Sisters, talking"
"over the dayâ s adventures, walked back and forth in twos and threes"
almost under the feet of the travellers; and shufflings and scufflings
in the branches showed that the bats were ready to go out on the
"night-picket. Swiftly the light gathered itself together, painted for"
an instant the faces and the cartwheels and the bullocksâ  horns as red
"as blood. Then the night fell, changing the touch of the air, drawing a"
"low, even haze, like a gossamer veil of blue, across the face of the"
"country, and bringing out, keen and distinct, the smell of wood-smoke"
and cattle and the good scent of wheaten cakes cooked on ashes. The
evening patrol hurried out of the police-station with important
coughings and reiterated orders; and a live charcoal ball in the cup of
a wayside carterâ s hookah glowed red while Kimâ s eye mechanically
watched the last flicker of the sun on the brass tweezers.

The life of the  parao  was very like that of the Kashmir Serai on a
"small scale. Kim dived into the happy Asiatic disorder which, if you"
"only allow time, will bring you everything that a simple man needs."

"His wants were few, because, since the lama had no caste scruples,"
"cooked food from the nearest stall would serve; but, for luxuryâ s sake,"
"Kim bought a handful of dung-cakes to build a fire. All about, coming"
"and going round the little flames, men cried for oil, or grain, or"
"sweetmeats, or tobacco, jostling one another while they waited their"
"turn at the well; and under the menâ s voices you heard from halted,"
shuttered carts the high squeals and giggles of women whose faces
should not be seen in public.

"Nowadays, well-educated natives are of opinion that when their"
womenfolk travelâ and they visit a good dealâ it is better to take them
quickly by rail in a properly screened compartment; and that custom is
spreading. But there are always those of the old rock who hold by the
"use of their forefathers; and, above all, there are always the old"
womenâ more conservative than the menâ who toward the end of their days
"go on a pilgrimage. They, being withered and undesirable, do not, under"
"certain circumstances, object to unveiling. After their long seclusion,"
during which they have always been in business touch with a thousand
"outside interests, they love the bustle and stir of the open road, the"
"gatherings at the shrines, and the infinite possibilities of gossip"
with like-minded dowagers. Very often it suits a longsuffering family
"that a strong-tongued, iron-willed old lady should disport herself"
about India in this fashion; for certainly pilgrimage is grateful to
"the Gods. So all about India, in the most remote places, as in the most"
"public, you find some knot of grizzled servitors in nominal charge of"
an old lady who is more or less curtained and hid away in a
"bullock-cart. Such men are staid and discreet, and when a European or a"
high-caste native is near will net their charge with most elaborate
precautions; but in the ordinary haphazard chances of pilgrimage the
"precautions are not taken. The old lady is, after all, intensely human,"
and lives to look upon life.

"Kim marked down a gaily ornamented  ruth  or family bullock-cart, with"
"a broidered canopy of two domes, like a double-humped camel, which had"
"just been drawn into the  parao . Eight men made its retinue, and two"
of the eight were armed with rusty sabresâ sure signs that they followed
"a person of distinction, for the common folk do not bear arms. An"
"increasing cackle of complaints, orders, and jests, and what to a"
"European would have been bad language, came from behind the curtains."
Here was evidently a woman used to command.

"Kim looked over the retinue critically. Half of them were thin-legged,"
"grey-bearded Ooryas from down country. The other half were duffle-clad,"
"felt-hatted hillmen of the North; and that mixture told its own tale,"
even if he had not overheard the incessant sparring between the two
divisions. The old lady was going south on a visitâ probably to a rich
"relative, most probably to a son-in-law, who had sent up an escort as a"
mark of respect. The hillmen would be of her own peopleâ Kulu or Kangra
folk. It was quite clear that she was not taking her daughter down to
"be wedded, or the curtains would have been laced home and the guard"
would have allowed no one near the car. A merry and a high-spirited
"dame, thought Kim, balancing the dung-cake in one hand, the cooked food"
"in the other, and piloting the lama with a nudging shoulder. Something"
"might be made out of the meeting. The lama would give him no help, but,"
"as a conscientious  chela , Kim was delighted to beg for two."

"He built his fire as close to the cart as he dared, waiting for one of"
"the escort to order him away. The lama dropped wearily to the ground,"
"much as a heavy fruit-eating bat cowers, and returned to his rosary."

"â Stand farther off, beggar!â  The order was shouted in broken Hindustani"
by one of the hillmen.

"â Huh! It is only a  pahari  (a hillman)â , said Kim over his shoulder."
â Since when have the hill-asses owned all Hindustan?â 

The retort was a swift and brilliant sketch of Kimâ s pedigree for three
generations.

"â Ah!â  Kimâ s voice was sweeter than ever, as he broke the dung-cake into"
fit pieces. â In  my  country we call that the beginning of love-talk.â 

"A harsh, thin cackle behind the curtains put the hillman on his mettle"
for a second shot.

"â Not so badâ not so bad,â  said Kim with calm. â But have a care, my"
"brother, lest weâ  we , I sayâ be minded to give a curse or so in return."
And our curses have the knack of biting home.â 

The Ooryas laughed; the hillman sprang forward threateningly. The lama
"suddenly raised his head, bringing his huge tam-oâ -shanter hat into the"
full light of Kimâ s new-started fire.

â What is it?â  said he.

The man halted as though struck to stone. â Iâ Iâ am saved from a great
"sin,â  he stammered."

"â The foreigner has found him a priest at last,â  whispered one of the"
Ooryas.

â Hai! Why is that beggar-brat not well beaten?â  the old woman cried.

The hillman drew back to the cart and whispered something to the
"curtain. There was dead silence, then a muttering."

"â This goes well,â  thought Kim, pretending neither to see nor hear."

â Whenâ whenâ he has eatenâ â the hillman fawned on Kimâ â itâ it is requested
that the Holy One will do the honour to talk to one who would speak to
him.â 

"â After he has eaten he will sleep,â  Kim returned loftily. He could not"
"quite see what new turn the game had taken, but stood resolute to"
"profit by it. â Now I will get him his food.â  The last sentence, spoken"
"loudly, ended with a sigh as of faintness."

â Iâ I myself and the others of my people will look to thatâ if it is
permitted.â 

"â It is permitted,â  said Kim, more loftily than ever. â Holy One, these"
people will bring us food.â 

â The land is good. All the country of the South is goodâ a great and a
"terrible world,â  mumbled the lama drowsily."

"â Let him sleep,â  said Kim, â but look to it that we are well fed when he"
wakes. He is a very holy man.â 

Again one of the Ooryas said something contemptuously.

"â He is not a  faquir . He is not a down-country beggar,â  Kim went on"
"severely, addressing the stars. â He is the most holy of holy men. He is"
above all castes. I am his  chela .â 

"â Come here!â  said the flat thin voice behind the curtain; and Kim came,"
conscious that eyes he could not see were staring at him. One skinny
"brown finger heavy with rings lay on the edge of the cart, and the talk"
went this way:

â Who is that one?â 

â An exceedingly holy one. He comes from far off. He comes from Tibet.â 

â Where in Tibet?â 

â From behind the snowsâ from a very far place. He knows the stars; he
makes horoscopes; he reads nativities. But he does not do this for
money. He does it for kindness and great charity. I am his disciple. I
am called also the Friend of the Stars.â 

â Thou art no hillman.â 

â Ask him. He will tell thee I was sent to him from the Stars to show
him an end to his pilgrimage.â 

"â Humph! Consider, brat, that I am an old woman and not altogether a"
"fool. Lamas I know, and to these I give reverence, but thou art no more"
a lawful  chela  than this my finger is the pole of this wagon. Thou
"art a casteless Hinduâ a bold and unblushing beggar, attached, belike,"
to the Holy One for the sake of gain.â 

â Do we not all work for gain?â  Kim changed his tone promptly to match
that altered voice. â I have heardâ â this was a bow drawn at a ventureâ â I
have heardâ â 

"â What hast thou heard?â  she snapped, rapping with the finger."

"â Nothing that I well remember, but some talk in the bazars, which is"
"doubtless a lie, that even Rajahsâ small Hill Rajahsâ â "

â But none the less of good Rajput blood.â 

â Assuredly of good blood. That these even sell the more comely of their
womenfolk for gain. Down south they sell themâ to zemindars and suchâ all
of Oudh.â 

If there be one thing in the world that the small Hill Rajahs deny it
is just this charge; but it happens to be one thing that the bazars
"believe, when they discuss the mysterious slave-traffics of India. The"
"old lady explained to Kim, in a tense, indignant whisper, precisely"
what manner and fashion of malignant liar he was. Had Kim hinted this
"when she was a girl, he would have been pommelled to death that same"
evening by an elephant. This was perfectly true.

"â Ahai! I am only a beggarâ s brat, as the Eye of Beauty has said,â  he"
wailed in extravagant terror.

"â Eye of Beauty, forsooth! Who am I that thou shouldst fling"
beggar-endearments at me?â  And yet she laughed at the long-forgotten
"word. â Forty years ago that might have been said, and not without"
truth. Ay. thirty years ago. But it is the fault of this gadding up and
"down Hind that a kingâ s widow must jostle all the scum of the land, and"
be made a mock by beggars.â 

"â Great Queen,â  said Kim promptly, for he heard her shaking with"
"indignation, â I am even what the Great Queen says I am; but none the"
less is my master holy. He has not yet heard the Great Queenâ s order
thatâ â 

â Order? I order a Holy Oneâ a Teacher of the Lawâ to come and speak to a
woman? Never!â 

â Pity my stupidity. I thought it was given as an orderâ â 

â It was not. It was a petition. Does this make all clear?â 

A silver coin clicked on the edge of the cart. Kim took it and salaamed
"profoundly. The old lady recognized that, as the eyes and the ears of"
"the lama, he was to be propitiated."

â I am but the Holy Oneâ s disciple. When he has eaten perhaps he will
come.â 

"â Oh, villain and shameless rogue!â  The jewelled forefinger shook itself"
at him reprovingly; but he could hear the old ladyâ s chuckle.

"â Nay, what is it?â  he said, dropping into his most caressing and"
"confidential toneâ the one, he well knew, that few could resist. â Isâ is"
"there any need of a son in thy family? Speak freely, for we priestsâ â "
That last was a direct plagiarism from a  faquir  by the Taksali Gate.

â We priests! Thou art not yet old enough toâ â  She checked the joke with
"another laugh. â Believe me, now and again, we women, O priest, think of"
"other matters than sons. Moreover, my daughter has borne her"
man-child.â 

â Two arrows in the quiver are better than one; and three are better
"still.â  Kim quoted the proverb with a meditative cough, looking"
discreetly earthward.

"â Trueâ oh, true. But perhaps that will come. Certainly those"
down-country Brahmins are utterly useless. I sent gifts and monies and
"gifts again to them, and they prophesied.â "

"â Ah,â  drawled Kim, with infinite contempt, â they prophesied!â  A"
professional could have done no better.

â And it was not till I remembered my own Gods that my prayers were
"heard. I chose an auspicious hour, andâ perhaps thy Holy One has heard"
"of the Abbot of the Lung-Cho lamassery. It was to him I put the matter,"
and behold in the due time all came about as I desired. The Brahmin in
the house of the father of my daughterâ s son has since said that it was
through  his  prayersâ which is a little error that I will explain to
him when we reach our journeyâ s end. And so afterwards I go to Buddh
"Gaya, to make  shraddha  for the father of my children.â "

â Thither go we.â 

"â Doubly auspicious,â  chirruped the old lady. â A second son at least!â "

"â O Friend of all the World!â  The lama had waked, and, simply as a child"
"bewildered in a strange bed, called for Kim."

"â I come! I come, Holy One!â  He dashed to the fire, where he found the"
"lama already surrounded by dishes of food, the hillmen visibly adoring"
him and the Southerners looking sourly.

â Go back! Withdraw!â  Kim cried. â Do we eat publicly like dogs?â  They
"finished the meal in silence, each turned a little from the other, and"
Kim topped it with a native-made cigarette.

â Have I not said an hundred times that the South is a good land? Here
"is a virtuous and high-born widow of a Hill Rajah on pilgrimage, she"
"says, to Buddha Gay. She it is sends us those dishes; and when thou art"
well rested she would speak to thee.â 

â Is this also thy work?â  The lama dipped deep into his snuff-gourd.

â Who else watched over thee since our wonderful journey began?â  Kimâ s
eyes danced in his head as he blew the rank smoke through his nostrils
and stretched him on the dusty ground. â Have I failed to oversee thy
"comforts, Holy One?â "

â A blessing on thee.â  The lama inclined his solemn head. â I have known
"many men in my so long life, and disciples not a few. But to none among"
"men, if so be thou art woman-born, has my heart gone out as it has to"
"theeâ thoughtful, wise, and courteous; but something of a small imp.â "

â And I have never seen such a priest as thou.â  Kim considered the
benevolent yellow face wrinkle by wrinkle. â It is less than three days
"since we took the road together, and it is as though it were a hundred"
years.â 

â Perhaps in a former life it was permitted that I should have rendered
"thee some service. Maybeâ â he smiledâ â I freed thee from a trap; or,"
"having caught thee on a hook in the days when I was not enlightened,"
cast thee back into the river.â 

"â Maybe,â  said Kim quietly. He had heard this sort of speculation again"
"and again, from the mouths of many whom the English would not consider"
"imaginative. â Now, as regards that woman in the bullock-cart.  I  think"
she needs a second son for her daughter.â 

"â That is no part of the Way,â  sighed the lama. â But at least she is"
"from the Hills. Ah, the Hills, and the snow of the Hills!â "

He rose and stalked to the cart. Kim would have given his ears to come
"too, but the lama did not invite him; and the few words he caught were"
"in an unknown tongue, for they spoke some common speech of the"
mountains. The woman seemed to ask questions which the lama turned over
in his mind before answering. Now and again he heard the singsong
cadence of a Chinese quotation. It was a strange picture that Kim
"watched between drooped eyelids. The lama, very straight and erect, the"
deep folds of his yellow clothing slashed with black in the light of
the  parao  fires precisely as a knotted tree-trunk is slashed with the
"shadows of the low sun, addressed a tinsel and lacquered  ruth  which"
burned like a many-coloured jewel in the same uncertain light. The
"patterns on the gold-worked curtains ran up and down, melting and"
reforming as the folds shook and quivered to the night wind; and when
the talk grew more earnest the jewelled forefinger snapped out little
sparks of light between the embroideries. Behind the cart was a wall of
uncertain darkness speckled with little flames and alive with
half-caught forms and faces and shadows. The voices of early evening
had settled down to one soothing hum whose deepest note was the steady
"chumping of the bullocks above their chopped straw, and whose highest"
was the tinkle of a Bengali dancing-girlâ s  sitar . Most men had eaten
"and pulled deep at their gurgling, grunting hookahs, which in full"
blast sound like bull-frogs.

At last the lama returned. A hillman walked behind him with a wadded
cotton-quilt and spread it carefully by the fire.

"â She deserves ten thousand grandchildren,â  thought Kim. â None the less,"
"but for me, those gifts would not have come.â "

"â A virtuous womanâ and a wise one.â  The lama slackened off, joint by"
"joint, like a slow camel. â The world is full of charity to those who"
follow the Way.â  He flung a fair half of the quilt over Kim.

â And what said she?â  Kim rolled up in his share of it.

â She asked me many questions and propounded many problemsâ the most of
which were idle tales which she had heard from devil-serving priests
"who pretend to follow the Way. Some I answered, and some I said were"
"foolish. Many wear the Robe, but few keep the Way.â "

"â True. That is true.â  Kim used the thoughtful, conciliatory tone of"
those who wish to draw confidences.

â But by her lights she is most right-minded. She desires greatly that
"we should go with her to Buddh Gaya; her road being ours, as I"
"understand, for many daysâ  journey to the southward.â "

â And?â 

â Patience a little. To this I said that my Search came before all
"things. She had heard many foolish legends, but this great truth of my"
River she had never heard. Such are the priests of the lower hills! She
"knew the Abbot of Lung-Cho, but she did not know of my Riverâ nor the"
tale of the Arrow.â 

â And?â 

"â I spoke therefore of the Search, and of the Way, and of matters that"
were profitable; she desiring only that I should accompany her and make
prayer for a second son.â 

"â Aha! â€˜We womenâ  do  not  think of anything save children,â  said Kim"
sleepily.

"â Now, since our roads run together for a while, I do not see that we in"
any way depart from our Search if so be we accompany herâ at least as
far asâ I have forgotten the name of the city.â 

"â OhÃ©!â  said Kim, turning and speaking in a sharp whisper to one of the"
Ooryas a few yards away. â Where is your masterâ s house?â 

"â A little behind Saharunpore, among the fruit gardens.â  He named the"
village.

"â That was the place,â  said the lama. â So far, at least, we can go with"
her.â 

"â Flies go to carrion,â  said the Oorya, in an abstracted voice."

â For the sick cow a crow; for the sick man a Brahmin.â  Kim breathed the
proverb impersonally to the shadow-tops of the trees overhead.

The Oorya grunted and held his peace.

"â So then we go with her, Holy One?â "

â Is there any reason against? I can still step aside and try all the
rivers that the road overpasses. She desires that I should come. She
very greatly desires it.â 

Kim stifled a laugh in the quilt. When once that imperious old lady had
recovered from her natural awe of a lama he thought it probable that
she would be worth listening to.

He was nearly asleep when the lama suddenly quoted a proverb: â The
husbands of the talkative have a great reward hereafter.â  Then Kim
"heard him snuff thrice, and dozed off, still laughing."

The diamond-bright dawn woke men and crows and bullocks together. Kim
"sat up and yawned, shook himself, and thrilled with delight. This was"
seeing the world in real truth; this was life as he would have
"itâ bustling and shouting, the buckling of belts, and beating of"
"bullocks and creaking of wheels, lighting of fires and cooking of food,"
and new sights at every turn of the approving eye. The morning mist
"swept off in a whorl of silver, the parrots shot away to some distant"
river in shrieking green hosts: all the well-wheels within ear-shot
"went to work. India was awake, and Kim was in the middle of it, more"
"awake and more excited than anyone, chewing on a twig that he would"
presently use as a toothbrush; for he borrowed right- and left-handedly
from all the customs of the country he knew and loved. There was no
need to worry about foodâ no need to spend a cowrie at the crowded
stalls. He was the disciple of a holy man annexed by a strong-willed
"old lady. All things would be prepared for them, and when they were"
respectfully invited so to do they would sit and eat. For the restâ Kim
giggled here as he cleaned his teethâ his hostess would rather heighten
"the enjoyment of the road. He inspected her bullocks critically, as"
they came up grunting and blowing under the yokes. If they went too
fastâ it was not likelyâ there would be a pleasant seat for himself along
"the pole; the lama would sit beside the driver. The escort, of course,"
"would walk. The old lady, equally of course, would talk a great deal,"
and by what he had heard that conversation would not lack salt. She was
"already ordering, haranguing, rebuking, and, it must be said, cursing"
her servants for delays.

"â Get her her pipe. In the name of the Gods, get her her pipe and stop"
"her ill-omened mouth,â  cried an Oorya, tying up his shapeless bundles"
of bedding. â She and the parrots are alike. They screech in the dawn.â 

â The lead-bullocks! Hai! Look to the lead-bullocks!â  They were backing
and wheeling as a grain-cartâ s axle caught them by the horns. â Son of
"an owl, where dost thou go?â  This to the grinning carter."

â Ai! Yai! Yai! That within there is the Queen of Delhi going to pray
"for a son,â  the man called back over his high load. â Room for the Queen"
of Delhi and her Prime Minister the grey monkey climbing up his own
sword!â  Another cart loaded with bark for a down-country tannery
"followed close behind, and its driver added a few compliments as the"
 ruth -bullocks backed and backed again.

From behind the shaking curtains came one volley of invective. It did
"not last long, but in kind and quality, in blistering, biting"
"appropriateness, it was beyond anything that even Kim had heard. He"
"could see the carterâ s bare chest collapse with amazement, as the man"
"salaamed reverently to the voice, leaped from the pole, and helped the"
escort haul their volcano on to the main road. Here the voice told him
"truthfully what sort of wife he had wedded, and what she was doing in"
his absence.

"â Oh,  shabash! â  murmured Kim, unable to contain himself, as the man"
slunk away.

"â Well done, indeed? It is a shame and a scandal that a poor woman may"
not go to make prayer to her Gods except she be jostled and insulted by
all the refuse of Hindustanâ that she must eat  gÃ¢li  (abuse) as men eat
 ghi . But I have yet a wag left to my tongueâ a word or two well spoken
that serves the occasion. And  still  am I without my tobacco! Who is
the one-eyed and luckless son of shame that has not yet prepared my
pipe?â 

"It was hastily thrust in by a hillman, and a trickle of thick smoke"
from each corner of the curtains showed that peace was restored.

"If Kim had walked proudly the day before, disciple of a holy man, today"
"he paced with tenfold pride in the train of a semi-royal procession,"
with a recognized place under the patronage of an old lady of charming
"manners and infinite resource. The escort, their heads tied up"
"native-fashion, fell in on either side the cart, shuffling enormous"
clouds of dust.

The lama and Kim walked a little to one side; Kim chewing his stick of
"sugarcane, and making way for no one under the status of a priest. They"
could hear the old ladyâ s tongue clack as steadily as a rice-husker.
She bade the escort tell her what was going on on the road; and so soon
as they were clear of the  parao  she flung back the curtains and
"peered out, her veil a third across her face. Her men did not eye her"
"directly when she addressed them, and thus the proprieties were more or"
less observed.

"A dark, sallowish District Superintendent of Police, faultlessly"
"uniformed, an Englishman, trotted by on a tired horse, and, seeing from"
"her retinue what manner of person she was, chaffed her."

"â O mother,â  he cried, â do they do this in the  zenanas?  Suppose an"
Englishman came by and saw that thou hast no nose?â 

"â What?â  she shrilled back. â Thine own mother has no nose? Why say so,"
"then, on the open road?â "

It was a fair counter. The Englishman threw up his hand with the
gesture of a man hit at sword-play. She laughed and nodded.

â Is this a face to tempt virtue aside?â  She withdrew all her veil and
stared at him.

"It was by no means lovely, but as the man gathered up his reins he"
"called it a Moon of Paradise, a Disturber of Integrity, and a few other"
fantastic epithets which doubled her up with mirth.

"â That is a  nut-cut  (rogue),â  she said. â All police-constables are"
" nut-cuts;  but the police-wallahs are the worst. Hai, my son, thou"
hast never learned all that since thou camest from  Belait  (Europe).
Who suckled thee?â 

"â A  pahareen â a hillwoman of Dalhousie, my mother. Keep thy beauty"
"under a shadeâ O Dispenser of Delights,â  and he was gone."

"â These be the sortâ â she took a fine judicial tone, and stuffed her"
mouth with  pan â â These be the sort to oversee justice. They know the
"land and the customs of the land. The others, all new from Europe,"
"suckled by white women and learning our tongues from books, are worse"
"than the pestilence. They do harm to Kings.â  Then she told a long, long"
"tale to the world at large, of an ignorant young policeman who had"
"disturbed some small Hill Rajah, a ninth cousin of her own, in the"
"matter of a trivial land-case, winding up with a quotation from a work"
by no means devotional.

"Then her mood changed, and she bade one of the escort ask whether the"
lama would walk alongside and discuss matters of religion. So Kim
dropped back into the dust and returned to his sugar-cane. For an hour
or more the lamaâ s tam-oâ shanter showed like a moon through the haze;
"and, from all he heard, Kim gathered that the old woman wept. One of"
"the Ooryas half apologized for his rudeness overnight, saying that he"
"had never known his mistress of so bland a temper, and he ascribed it"
"to the presence of the strange priest. Personally, he believed in"
"Brahmins, though, like all natives, he was acutely aware of their"
"cunning and their greed. Still, when Brahmins but irritated with"
"begging demands the mother of his masterâ s wife, and when she sent them"
away so angry that they cursed the whole retinue (which was the real
"reason of the second off-side bullock going lame, and of the pole"
"breaking the night before), he was prepared to accept any priest of any"
other denomination in or out of India. To this Kim assented with wise
"nods, and bade the Oorya observe that the lama took no money, and that"
the cost of his and Kimâ s food would be repaid a hundred times in the
good luck that would attend the caravan henceforward. He also told
"stories of Lahore city, and sang a song or two which made the escort"
laugh. As a town-mouse well acquainted with the latest songs by the
most fashionable composersâ they are women for the most partâ Kim had a
distinct advantage over men from a little fruit-village behind
"Saharunpore, but he let that advantage be inferred."

"At noon they turned aside to eat, and the meal was good, plentiful, and"
"well-served on plates of clean leaves, in decency, out of drift of the"
"dust. They gave the scraps to certain beggars, that all requirements"
"might be fulfilled, and sat down to a long, luxurious smoke. The old"
"lady had retreated behind her curtains, but mixed most freely in the"
"talk, her servants arguing with and contradicting her as servants do"
throughout the East. She compared the cool and the pines of the Kangra
and Kulu hills with the dust and the mangoes of the South; she told a
tale of some old local Gods at the edge of her husbandâ s territory; she
"roundly abused the tobacco which she was then smoking, reviled all"
"Brahmins, and speculated without reserve on the coming of many"
grandsons.




CHAPTER V


Here come I to my own again
"Fed, forgiven, and known again"
"Claimed by bone of my bone again,"
And sib to flesh of my flesh!
"The fatted calf is dressed for me,"
But the husks have greater zest for me ...
"I think my pigs will be best for me,"
So Iâ m off to the styes afresh.

 The Prodigal Son .

"Once more the lazy, string-tied, shuffling procession got under way,"
and she slept till they reached the next halting-stage. It was a very
"short march, and time lacked an hour to sundown, so Kim cast about for"
means of amusement.

â But why not sit and rest?â  said one of the escort. â Only the devils
and the English walk to and fro without reason.â 

"â Never make friends with the Devil, a Monkey, or a Boy. No man knows"
"what they will do next,â  said his fellow."

Kim turned a scornful backâ he did not want to hear the old story how
the Devil played with the boys and repented of it and walked idly
across country.

"The lama strode after him. All that day, whenever they passed a stream,"
"he had turned aside to look at it, but in no case had he received any"
"warning that he had found his River. Insensibly, too, the comfort of"
"speaking to someone in a reasonable tongue, and of being properly"
"considered and respected as her spiritual adviser by a well-born woman,"
"had weaned his thoughts a little from the Search. And further, he was"
prepared to spend serene years in his quest; having nothing of the
"white manâ s impatience, but a great faith."

â Where goest thou?â  he called after Kim.

"â Nowhitherâ it was a small march, and all thisâ â Kim waved his hands"
abroadâ â is new to me.â 

â She is beyond question a wise and a discerning woman. But it is hard
to meditate whenâ â 

â All women are thus.â  Kim spoke as might have Solomon.

"â Before the lamassery was a broad platform,â  the lama muttered, looping"
"up the well-worn rosary, â of stone. On that I have left the marks of my"
feetâ pacing to and fro with these.â 

"He clicked the beads, and began the â  Om mane pudme hum â  of his"
"devotion; grateful for the cool, the quiet, and the absence of dust."

One thing after another drew Kimâ s idle eye across the plain. There was
"no purpose in his wanderings, except that the build of the huts near by"
"seemed new, and he wished to investigate."

"They came out on a broad tract of grazing-ground, brown and purple in"
"the afternoon light, with a heavy clump of mangoes in the centre. It"
struck Kim as curious that no shrine stood in so eligible a spot: the
boy was observing as any priest for these things. Far across the plain
"walked side by side four men, made small by the distance. He looked"
intently under his curved palms and caught the sheen of brass.

â Soldiers. White soldiers!â  said he. â Let us see.â 

â It is always soldiers when thou and I go out alone together. But I
have never seen the white soldiers.â 

â They do no harm except when they are drunk. Keep behind this tree.â 

They stepped behind the thick trunks in the cool dark of the
mango-tope. Two little figures halted; the other two came forward
"uncertainly. They were the advance-party of a regiment on the march,"
"sent out, as usual, to mark the camp. They bore five-foot sticks with"
"fluttering flags, and called to each other as they spread over the flat"
earth.

"At last they entered the mango-grove, walking heavily."

"â Itâ s here or hereaboutsâ officersâ  tents under the trees, I take it,"
anâ  the rest of us can stay outside. Have they marked out for the
baggage-wagons behind?â 

"They cried again to their comrades in the distance, and the rough"
answer came back faint and mellowed.

"â Shove the flag in here, then,â  said one."

"â What do they prepare?â  said the lama, wonderstruck. â This is a great"
and terrible world. What is the device on the flag?â 

"A soldier thrust a stave within a few feet of them, grunted"
"discontentedly, pulled it up again, conferred with his companion, who"
"looked up and down the shaded cave of greenery, and returned it."

"Kim stared with all his eyes, his breath coming short and sharp between"
his teeth. The soldiers stamped off into the sunshine.

â O Holy One!â  he gasped. â My horoscope! The drawing in the dust by the
priest at Umballa! Remember what he said. First come twoâ  ferashes â to
"make all things readyâ in a dark place, as it is always at the beginning"
of a vision.â 

"â But this is not vision,â  said the lama. â It is the worldâ s Illusion,"
and no more.â 

â And after them comes the Bullâ the Red Bull on the green field. Look!
It is he!â 

He pointed to the flag that was snap snapping in the evening breeze not
ten feet away. It was no more than an ordinary camp marking-flag; but
"the regiment, always punctilious in matters of millinery, had charged"
"it with the regimental device, the Red Bull, which is the crest of the"
Mavericksâ the great Red Bull on a background of Irish green.

"â I see, and now I remember.â  said the lama. â Certainly it is thy Bull."
"Certainly, also, the two men came to make all ready.â "

â They are soldiersâ white soldiers. What said the priest? â€˜The sign over
"against the Bull is the sign of War and armed men.â  Holy One, this"
thing touches my Search.â 

â True. It is true.â  The lama stared fixedly at the device that flamed
like a ruby in the dusk. â The priest at Umballa said that thine was the
sign of War.â 

â What is to do now?â 

â Wait. Let us wait.â 

"â Even now the darkness clears,â  said Kim. It was only natural that the"
"descending sun should at last strike through the tree-trunks, across"
"the grove, filling it with mealy gold light for a few minutes; but to"
Kim it was the crown of the Umballa Brahminâ s prophecy.

â Hark!â  said the lama. â One beats a drumâ far off!â 

"At first the sound, carrying diluted through the still air, resembled"
the beating of an artery in the head. Soon a sharpness was added.

"â Ah! The music,â  Kim explained. He knew the sound of a regimental band,"
but it amazed the lama.

"At the far end of the plain a heavy, dusty column crawled in sight."
Then the wind brought the tune:

We crave your condescension
To tell you what we know
Of marching in the Mulligan Guards
To Sligo Port below!

Here broke in the shrill-tongued fifes:

"We shouldered arms,"
We marchedâ we marched away.
From PhÅ“nix Park
We marched to Dublin Bay.
"The drums and the fifes,"
"Oh, sweetly they did play,"
As we marchedâ marchedâ marchedâ with the
Mulligan Guards!

It was the band of the Mavericks playing the regiment to camp; for the
men were route-marching with their baggage. The rippling column swung
"into the levelâ carts behind it divided left and right, ran about like"
"an ant-hill, and ..."

â But this is sorcery!â  said the lama.

"The plain dotted itself with tents that seemed to rise, all spread,"
"from the carts. Another rush of men invaded the grove, pitched a huge"
"tent in silence, ran up yet eight or nine more by the side of it,"
"unearthed cooking-pots, pans, and bundles, which were taken possession"
of by a crowd of native servants; and behold the mango-tope turned into
an orderly town as they watched!

"â Let us go,â  said the lama, sinking back afraid, as the fires twinkled"
and white officers with jingling swords stalked into the Mess-tent.

"â Stand back in the shadow. No one can see beyond the light of a fire,â "
"said Kim, his eyes still on the flag. He had never before watched the"
routine of a seasoned regiment pitching camp in thirty minutes.

â Look! look! look!â  clucked the lama. â Yonder comes a priest.â  It was
"Bennett, the Church of England Chaplain of the regiment, limping in"
dusty black. One of his flock had made some rude remarks about the
Chaplainâ s mettle; and to abash him Bennett had marched step by step
"with the men that day. The black dress, gold cross on the watch-chain,"
"the hairless face, and the soft, black wideawake hat would have marked"
him as a holy man anywhere in all India. He dropped into a camp-chair
by the door of the Mess-tent and slid off his boots. Three or four
"officers gathered round him, laughing and joking over his exploit."

"â The talk of white men is wholly lacking in dignity,â  said the lama,"
who judged only by tone. â But I considered the countenance of that
priest and I think he is learned. Is it likely that he will understand
our talk? I would talk to him of my Search.â 

"â Never speak to a white man till he is fed,â  said Kim, quoting a"
"well-known proverb. â They will eat now, andâ and I do not think they are"
good to beg from. Let us go back to the resting-place. After we have
eaten we will come again. It certainly was a Red Bullâ  my  Red Bull.â 

They were both noticeably absent-minded when the old ladyâ s retinue set
"their meal before them; so none broke their reserve, for it is not"
lucky to annoy guests.

"â Now,â  said Kim, picking his teeth, â we will return to that place; but"
"thou, O Holy One, must wait a little way off, because thy feet are"
heavier than mine and I am anxious to see more of that Red Bull.â 

â But how canst thou understand the talk? Walk slowly. The road is
"dark,â  the lama replied uneasily."

"Kim put the question aside. â I marked a place near to the trees,â  said"
"he, â where thou canst sit till I call. Nay,â  as the lama made some sort"
"of protest, â remember this is  my  Searchâ the Search for my Red Bull."
The sign in the Stars was not for thee. I know a little of the customs
"of white soldiers, and I always desire to see some new things.â "

â What dost thou not know of this world?â  The lama squatted obediently
in a little hollow of the ground not a hundred yards from the hump of
the mango-trees dark against the star-powdered sky.

â Stay till I call.â  Kim flitted into the dusk. He knew that in all
"probability there would be sentries round the camp, and smiled to"
himself as he heard the thick boots of one. A boy who can dodge over
"the roofs of Lahore city on a moonlight night, using every little patch"
"and corner of darkness to discomfit his pursuer, is not likely to be"
checked by a line of well-trained soldiers. He paid them the compliment
"of crawling between a couple, and, running and halting, crouching and"
"dropping flat, worked his way toward the lighted Mess-tent where, close"
"pressed behind the mango-tree, he waited till some chance word should"
give him a returnable lead.

The one thing now in his mind was further information as to the Red
"Bull. For aught he knew, and Kimâ s limitations were as curious and"
"sudden as his expansions, the men, the nine hundred thorough devils of"
"his fatherâ s prophecy, might pray to the beast after dark, as Hindus"
pray to the Holy Cow. That at least would be entirely right and
"logical, and the padre with the gold cross would be therefore the man"
"to consult in the matter. On the other hand, remembering sober-faced"
"padres whom he had avoided in Lahore city, the priest might be an"
inquisitive nuisance who would bid him learn. But had it not been
proven at Umballa that his sign in the high heavens portended War and
armed men? Was he not the Friend of the Stars as well as of all the
"World, crammed to the teeth with dreadful secrets? Lastlyâ and firstly"
"as the undercurrent of all his quick thoughtsâ this adventure, though he"
"did not know the English word, was a stupendous larkâ a delightful"
"continuation of his old flights across the housetops, as well as the"
fulfilment of sublime prophecy. He lay belly-flat and wriggled towards
"the Mess-tent door, a hand on the amulet round his neck."

It was as he suspected. The Sahibs prayed to their God; for in the
centre of the Mess-tableâ its sole ornament when they were on the line
of marchâ stood a golden bull fashioned from old-time loot of the Summer
"Palace at Pekinâ a red-gold bull with lowered head, ramping upon a field"
of Irish green. To him the Sahibs held out their glasses and cried
aloud confusedly.

"Now the Reverend Arthur Bennett always left Mess after that toast, and"
being rather tired by his march his movements were more abrupt than
"usual. Kim, with slightly raised head, was still staring at his totem"
"on the table, when the Chaplain stepped on his right shoulder-blade."
"Kim flinched under the leather, and, rolling sideways, brought down the"
"Chaplain, who, ever a man of action, caught him by the throat and"
nearly choked the life out of him. Kim then kicked him desperately in
"the stomach. Mr Bennett gasped and doubled up, but without relaxing his"
"grip, rolled over again, and silently hauled Kim to his own tent. The"
Mavericks were incurable practical jokers; and it occurred to the
Englishman that silence was best till he had made complete inquiry.

"â Why, itâ s a boy!â  he said, as he drew his prize under the light of the"
"tent-pole lantern, then shaking him severely cried: â What were you"
doing? Youâ re a thief.  Choor? Mallum? â  His Hindustanee was very
"limited, and the ruffled and disgusted Kim intended to keep to the"
character laid down for him. As he recovered his breath he was
inventing a beautifully plausible tale of his relations to some
"scullion, and at the same time keeping a keen eye on and a little under"
the Chaplainâ s left arm-pit. The chance came; he ducked for the
"doorway, but a long arm shot out and clutched at his neck, snapping the"
amulet-string and closing on the amulet.

"â Give it me. O, give it me. Is it lost? Give me the papers.â "

"The words were in Englishâ the tinny, saw-cut English of the"
"native-bred, and the Chaplain jumped."

"â A scapular,â  said he, opening his hand. â No, some sort of heathen"
"charm. Whyâ why, do you speak English? Little boys who steal are beaten."
You know that?â 

â I do notâ I did not steal.â  Kim danced in agony like a terrier at a
"lifted stick. â Oh, give it me. It is my charm. Do not thieve it from"
me.â 

"The Chaplain took no heed, but, going to the tent door, called aloud. A"
"fattish, clean-shaven man appeared."

"â I want your advice, Father Victor,â  said Bennett. â I found this boy in"
"the dark outside the Mess-tent. Ordinarily, I should have chastised him"
"and let him go, because I believe him to be a thief. But it seems he"
"talks English, and he attaches some sort of value to a charm round his"
neck. I thought perhaps you might help me.â 

Between himself and the Roman Catholic Chaplain of the Irish contingent
"lay, as Bennett believed, an unbridgeable gulf, but it was noticeable"
that whenever the Church of England dealt with a human problem she was
very likely to call in the Church of Rome. Bennettâ s official
abhorrence of the Scarlet Woman and all her ways was only equalled by
his private respect for Father Victor.

"â A thief talking English, is it? Letâ s look at his charm. No, itâ s not"
"a scapular, Bennett.â  He held out his hand."

â But have we any right to open it? A sound whippingâ â 

"â I did  not  thieve,â  protested Kim. â You have hit me kicks all over my"
body. Now give me my charm and I will go away.â 

"â Not quite so fast. Weâ ll look first,â  said Father Victor, leisurely"
"rolling out poor Kimball Oâ Haraâ s â  ne varietur â  parchment, his"
"clearance-certificate, and Kimâ s baptismal certificate. On this last"
Oâ Haraâ with some confused idea that he was doing wonders for his
sonâ had scrawled scores of times: â  Look after the boy. Please look
after the boy â â signing his name and regimental number in full.

"â Powers of Darkness below!â  said Father Victor, passing all over to Mr"
Bennett. â Do you know what these things are?â 

"â Yes.â  said Kim. â They are mine, and I want to go away.â "

"â I do not quite understand,â  said Mr Bennett. â He probably brought them"
on purpose. It may be a begging trick of some kind.â 

"â I never saw a beggar less anxious to stay with his company, then."
"Thereâ s the makings of a gay mystery here. Ye believe in Providence,"
Bennett?â 

â I hope so.â 

"â Well, I believe in miracles, so it comes to the same thing. Powers of"
"Darkness! Kimball Oâ Hara! And his son! But then heâ s a native, and I"
saw Kimball married myself to Annie Shott. How long have you had these
"things, boy?â "

â Ever since I was a little baby.â 

Father Victor stepped forward quickly and opened the front of Kimâ s
"upper garment. â You see, Bennett, heâ s not very black. Whatâ s your"
name?â 

â Kim.â 

â Or Kimball?â 

â Perhaps. Will you let me go away?â 

â What else?â 

â They call me Kim Rishti ke. That is Kim of the Rishti.â 

â What is thatâ â€˜Rishtiâ ?â 

â  Eye -rishtiâ that was the Regimentâ my fatherâ s.â 

"â Irishâ oh, I see.â "

"â Yess. That was how my father told me. My father, he has lived.â "

â Has lived where?â 

â Has lived. Of  course  he is deadâ gone-out.â 

"â Oh! Thatâ s your abrupt way of putting it, is it?â "

Bennett interrupted. â It is possible I have done the boy an injustice.
"He is certainly white, though evidently neglected. I am sure I must"
have bruised him. I do not think spiritsâ â 

"â Get him a glass of sherry, then, and let him squat on the cot. Now,"
"Kim,â  continued Father Victor, â no one is going to hurt you. Drink that"
"down and tell us about yourself. The truth, if youâ ve no objection.â "

"Kim coughed a little as he put down the empty glass, and considered."
This seemed a time for caution and fancy. Small boys who prowl about
camps are generally turned out after a whipping. But he had received no
"stripes; the amulet was evidently working in his favour, and it looked"
as though the Umballa horoscope and the few words that he could
remember of his fatherâ s maunderings fitted in most miraculously. Else
"why did the fat padre seem so impressed, and why the glass of hot"
yellow drink from the lean one?

"â My father, he is dead in Lahore city since I was very little. The"
"woman, she kept  kabarri  shop near where the hire-carriages are.â  Kim"
"began with a plunge, not quite sure how far the truth would serve him."

â Your mother?â 

â  No! â â with a gesture of disgust. â She went out when I was born. My
"father, he got these papers from the Jadoo-Gher what do you call that?â "
(Bennett nodded) â because he was in good-standing. What do you call
"that?â  (again Bennett nodded). â My father told me that. He said, too,"
and also the Brahmin who made the drawing in the dust at Umballa two
"days ago,  he  said, that I shall find a Red Bull on a green field and"
that the Bull shall help me.â 

"â A phenomenal little liar,â  muttered Bennett."

"â Powers of Darkness below, what a country!â  murmured Father Victor. â Go"
"on, Kim.â "

"â I did  not  thieve. Besides, I am just now disciple of a very holy"
"man. He is sitting outside. We saw two men come with flags, making the"
"place ready. That is  always  so in a dream, or on account of"
aâ aâ prophecy. So I knew it was come true. I saw the Red Bull on the
"green field, and my father he said: â€˜Nine hundred  pukka  devils and"
the Colonel riding on a horse will look after you when you find the Red
"Bull!â  I did not know what to do when I saw the Bull, but I went away"
"and I came again when it was dark. I wanted to see the Bull again, and"
I saw the Bull again with theâ the Sahibs praying to it. I think the
Bull shall help me. The holy man said so too. He is sitting outside.
"Will you hurt him, if I call him a shout now? He is very holy. He can"
"witness to all the things I say, and he knows I am not a thief.â "

â â€˜Sahibs praying to a bull!â  What in the world do you make of that?â 
said Bennett. â â€˜Disciple of a holy man!â  Is the boy mad?â 

"â Itâ s Oâ Haraâ s boy, sure enough. Oâ Haraâ s boy leagued with all the"
Powers of Darkness. Itâ s very much what his father would have done if
he was drunk. Weâ d better invite the holy man. He may know something.â 

"â He does not know anything,â  said Kim. â I will show you him if you"
come. He is my master. Then afterwards we can go.â 

"â Powers of Darkness!â  was all that Father Victor could say, as Bennett"
"marched off, with a firm hand on Kimâ s shoulder."

They found the lama where he had dropped.

"â The Search is at an end for me,â  shouted Kim in the vernacular. â I"
"have found the Bull, but God knows what comes next. They will not hurt"
you. Come to the fat priestâ s tent with this thin man and see the end.
"It is all new, and they cannot talk Hindi. They are only uncurried"
donkeys.â 

"â Then it is not well to make a jest of their ignorance,â  the lama"
"returned. â I am glad if thou art rejoiced,  chela .â "

"Dignified and unsuspicious, he strode into the little tent, saluted the"
"Churches as a Churchman, and sat down by the open charcoal brazier. The"
yellow lining of the tent reflected in the lamplight made his face
red-gold.

Bennett looked at him with the triple-ringed uninterest of the creed
that lumps nine-tenths of the world under the title of â heathenâ .

â And what was the end of the Search? What gift has the Red Bull
brought?â  The lama addressed himself to Kim.

"â He says, â€˜What are you going to do?â â  Bennett was staring uneasily at"
"Father Victor, and Kim, for his own ends, took upon himself the office"
of interpreter.

"â I do not see what concern this  faquir  has with the boy, who is"
"probably his dupe or his confederate,â  Bennett began. â We cannot allow"
"an English boyâ Assuming that he is the son of a Mason, the sooner he"
goes to the Masonic Orphanage the better.â 

"â Ah! Thatâ s your opinion as Secretary to the Regimental Lodge,â  said"
Father Victor; â but we might as well tell the old man what we are going
to do. He doesnâ t look like a villain.â 

"â My experience is that one can never fathom the Oriental mind. Now,"
"Kimball, I wish you to tell this man what I say word for word.â "

Kim gathered the import of the next few sentences and began thus:

"â Holy One, the thin fool who looks like a camel says that I am the son"
of a Sahib.â 

â But how?â 

"â Oh, it is true. I knew it since my birth, but  he  could only find it"
out by rending the amulet from my neck and reading all the papers. He
"thinks that once a Sahib is always a Sahib, and between the two of them"
they purpose to keep me in this Regiment or to send me to a  madrissah 
(a school). It has happened before. I have always avoided it. The fat
fool is of one mind and the camel-like one of another. But that is no
odds. I may spend one night here and perhaps the next. It has happened
before. Then I will run away and return to thee.â 

â But tell them that thou art my  chela . Tell them how thou didst come
"to me when I was faint and bewildered. Tell them of our Search, and"
they will surely let thee go now.â 

"â I have already told them. They laugh, and they talk of the police.â "

â What are you saying?â  asked Mr Bennett.

â Oah. He only says that if you do not let me go it will stop him in his
businessâ his ur-gent private af-fairs.â  This last was a reminiscence of
"some talk with a Eurasian clerk in the Canal Department, but it only"
"drew a smile, which nettled him. â And if you  did  know what his"
business was you would not be in such a beastly hurry to interfere.â 

"â What is it then?â  said Father Victor, not without feeling, as he"
watched the lamaâ s face.

â There is a River in this country which he wishes to find so verree
much. It was put out by an Arrow whichâ â  Kim tapped his foot
impatiently as he translated in his own mind from the vernacular to his
"clumsy English. â Oah, it was made by our Lord God Buddha, you know, and"
if you wash there you are washed away from all your sins and made as
white as cotton-wool.â  (Kim had heard mission-talk in his time.) â I am
"his disciple, and we  must  find that River. It is so verree valuable"
to us.â 

"â Say that again,â  said Bennett. Kim obeyed, with amplifications."

â But this is gross blasphemy!â  cried the Church of England.

â Tck! Tck!â  said Father Victor sympathetically. â Iâ d give a good deal
to be able to talk the vernacular. A river that washes away sin! And
how long have you two been looking for it?â 

"â Oh, many days. Now we wish to go away and look for it again. It is not"
"here, you see.â "

"â I see,â  said Father Victor gravely. â But he canâ t go on in that old"
"manâ s company. It would be different, Kim, if you were not a soldierâ s"
son. Tell him that the Regiment will take care of you and make you as
good a man as yourâ as good a man as can be. Tell him that if he
believes in miracles he must believe thatâ â 

"â There is no need to play on his credulity,â  Bennett interrupted."

â Iâ m doing no such thing. He must believe that the boyâ s coming hereâ to
his own Regimentâ in search of his Red Bull is in the nature of a
"miracle. Consider the chances against it, Bennett. This one boy in all"
"India, and our Regiment of all others on the line oâ  march for him to"
"meet with! Itâ s predestined on the face of it. Yes, tell him itâ s"
" Kismet. Kismet, mallum?  (Do you understand?)â "

"He turned towards the lama, to whom he might as well have talked of"
Mesopotamia.

"â They say,â â the old manâ s eye lighted at Kimâ s speech â they say that"
"the meaning of my horoscope is now accomplished, and that being led"
backâ though as thou knowest I went out of curiosityâ to these people and
their Red Bull I must needs go to a  madrissah  and be turned into a
"Sahib. Now I make pretence of agreement, for at the worst it will be"
but a few meals eaten away from thee. Then I will slip away and follow
"down the road to Saharunpore. Therefore, Holy One, keep with that Kulu"
womanâ on no account stray far from her cart till I come again. Past
"question, my sign is of War and of armed men. See how they have given"
me wine to drink and set me upon a bed of honour! My father must have
"been some great person. So if they raise me to honour among them, good."
"If not, good again. However it goes, I will run back to thee when I am"
"tired. But stay with the Rajputni, or I shall miss thy feet ... Oah"
"yess,â  said the boy, â I have told him everything you tell me to say.â "

"â And I cannot see any need why he should wait,â  said Bennett, feeling"
in his trouser-pocket. â We can investigate the details laterâ and I will
give him a ruâ â 

"â Give him time. Maybe heâ s fond of the lad,â  said Father Victor, half"
arresting the clergymanâ s motion.

The lama dragged forth his rosary and pulled his huge hat-brim over his
eyes.

â What can he want now?â 

â He saysâ â Kim put up one hand. â He says: â€˜Be quiet.â  He wants to speak
"to me by himself. You see, you do not know one little word of what he"
"says, and I think if you talk he will perhaps give you very bad curses."
"When he takes those beads like that, you see, he always wants to be"
quiet.â 

"The two Englishmen sat overwhelmed, but there was a look in Bennettâ s"
eye that promised ill for Kim when he should be relaxed to the
religious arm.

â A Sahib and the son of a Sahibâ â  The lamaâ s voice was harsh with pain.
â But no white man knows the land and the customs of the land as thou
knowest. How comes it this is true?â 

"â What matter, Holy One?â but remember it is only for a night or two."
"Remember, I can change swiftly. It will all be as it was when I first"
spoke to thee under Zam-Zammah the great gunâ â 

â As a boy in the dress of white menâ when I first went to the Wonder
House. And a second time thou wast a Hindu. What shall the third
"incarnation be?â  He chuckled drearily. â Ah,  chela , thou has done a"
wrong to an old man because my heart went out to thee.â 

â And mine to thee. But how could I know that the Red Bull would bring
me to this business?â 

"The lama covered his face afresh, and nervously rattled the rosary. Kim"
squatted beside him and laid hold upon a fold of his clothing.

â Now it is understood that the boy is a Sahib?â  he went on in a muffled
tone. â Such a Sahib as was he who kept the images in the Wonder House.â 
The lamaâ s experience of white men was limited. He seemed to be
repeating a lesson. â So then it is not seemly that he should do other
than as the Sahibs do. He must go back to his own people.â 

"â For a day and a night and a day,â  Kim pleaded."

"â No, ye donâ t!â  Father Victor saw Kim edging towards the door, and"
interposed a strong leg.

â I do not understand the customs of white men. The Priest of the Images
in the Wonder House in Lahore was more courteous than the thin one
here. This boy will be taken from me. They will make a Sahib of my
disciple? Woe to me! How shall I find my River? Have  they  no
disciples? Ask.â 

â He says he is very sorree that he cannot find the River now any more.
"He says, Why have you no disciples, and stop bothering him? He wants to"
be washed of his sins.â 

Neither Bennett nor Father Victor found any answer ready.

"Said Kim in English, distressed for the lamaâ s agony: â I think if you"
will let me go now we will walk away quietly and not steal. We will
look for that River like before I was caught. I wish I did not come
here to find the Red Bull and all that sort of thing. I do not want
it.â 

"â Itâ s the very best dayâ s work you ever did for yourself, young man,â "
said Bennett.

"â Good heavens, I donâ t know how to console him,â  said Father Victor,"
"watching the lama intently. â He canâ t take the boy away with him, and"
"yet heâ s a good manâ Iâ m sure heâ s a good man. Bennett, if you give him"
that rupee heâ ll curse you root and branch!â 

They listened to each otherâ s breathingâ threeâ five full minutes. Then
"the lama raised his head, and looked forth across them into space and"
emptiness.

"â And I am a Follower of the Way,â  he said bitterly. â The sin is mine"
and the punishment is mine. I made believe to myself for now I see it
was but make-beliefâ that thou wast sent to me to aid in the Search. So
my heart went out to thee for thy charity and thy courtesy and the
wisdom of thy little years. But those who follow the Way must permit
"not the fire of any desire or attachment, for that is all Illusion. As"
"says ...â  He quoted an old, old Chinese text, backed it with another,"
"and reinforced these with a third. â I stepped aside from the Way, my"
" chela . It was no fault of thine. I delighted in the sight of life,"
"the new people upon the roads, and in thy joy at seeing these things. I"
was pleased with thee who should have considered my Search and my
Search alone. Now I am sorrowful because thou art taken away and my
River is far from me. It is the Law which I have broken!â 

"â Powers of Darkness below!â  said Father Victor, who, wise in the"
"confessional, heard the pain in every sentence."

â I see now that the sign of the Red Bull was a sign for me as well as
for thee. All Desire is redâ and evil. I will do penance and find my
River alone.â 

"â At least go back to the Kulu woman,â  said Kim, â otherwise thou wilt be"
lost upon the roads. She will feed thee till I run back to thee.â 

The lama waved a hand to show that the matter was finally settled in
his mind.

"â Now,â â his tone altered as he turned to Kim,â â what will they do with"
"thee? At least I may, acquiring merit, wipe out past ill.â "

â Make me a Sahibâ so they think. The day after tomorrow I return. Do not
grieve.â 

â Of what sort? Such an one as this or that man?â  He pointed to Father
"Victor. â Such an one as those I saw this evening, men wearing swords"
and stamping heavily?â 

â Maybe.â 

â That is not well. These men follow desire and come to emptiness. Thou
must not be of their sort.â 

"â The Umballa priest said that my Star was War,â  Kim interjected. â I"
will ask these foolsâ but there is truly no need. I will run away this
"night, for all I wanted to see the new things.â "

"Kim put two or three questions in English to Father Victor, translating"
the replies to the lama.

"Then: â He says, â€˜You take him from me and you cannot say what you will"
"make him.â  He says, â€˜Tell me before I go, for it is not a small thing"
to make a child.â â 

"â You will be sent to a school. Later on, we shall see. Kimball, I"
suppose youâ d like to be a soldier?â 

â  Gorah-log  (white-folk). No-ah! No-ah!â  Kim shook his head violently.
There was nothing in his composition to which drill and routine
appealed. â I will not be a soldier.â 

"â You will be what youâ re told to be,â  said Bennett; â and you should be"
grateful that weâ re going to help you.â 

Kim smiled compassionately. If these men lay under the delusion that he
"would do anything that he did not fancy, so much the better."

"Another long silence followed. Bennett fidgeted with impatience, and"
suggested calling a sentry to evict the  faquir .

"â Do they give or sell learning among the Sahibs? Ask them,â  said the"
"lama, and Kim interpreted."

â They say that money is paid to the teacherâ but that money the Regiment
will give ... What need? It is only for a night.â 

â Andâ the more money is paid the better learning is given?â  The lama
disregarded Kimâ s plans for an early flight. â It is no wrong to pay for
learning. To help the ignorant to wisdom is always a merit.â  The rosary
clicked furiously as an abacus. Then he faced his oppressors.

â Ask them for how much money do they give a wise and suitable teaching?
And in what city is that teaching given?â 

"â Well,â  said Father Victor in English, when Kim had translated, â that"
depends. The Regiment would pay for you all the time you are at the
Military Orphanage; or you might go on the Punjab Masonic Orphanageâ s
list (not that he or you â ud understand what that means); but the best
"schooling a boy can get in India is, of course, at St Xavierâ s in"
"Partibus at Lucknow.â  This took some time to interpret, for Bennett"
wished to cut it short.

â He wants to know how much?â  said Kim placidly.

â Two or three hundred rupees a year.â  Father Victor was long past any
"sense of amazement. Bennett, impatient, did not understand."

â He says: â€˜Write that name and the money upon a paper and give it him.â 
"And he says you must write your name below, because he is going to"
write a letter in some days to you. He says you are a good man. He says
the other man is a fool. He is going away.â 

"The lama rose suddenly. â I follow my Search,â  he cried, and was gone."

"â Heâ ll run slap into the sentries,â  cried Father Victor, jumping up as"
the lama stalked out; â but I canâ t leave the boy.â  Kim made swift
"motion to follow, but checked himself. There was no sound of challenge"
outside. The lama had disappeared.

Kim settled himself composedly on the Chaplainâ s cot. At least the lama
"had promised that he would stay with the Raiput woman from Kulu, and"
the rest was of the smallest importance. It pleased him that the two
"padres were so evidently excited. They talked long in undertones,"
"Father Victor urging some scheme on Mr Bennett, who seemed incredulous."
"All this was very new and fascinating, but Kim felt sleepy. They called"
"men into the tentâ one of them certainly was the Colonel, as his father"
"had prophesiedâ and they asked him an infinity of questions, chiefly"
"about the woman who looked after him, all of which Kim answered"
truthfully. They did not seem to think the woman a good guardian.

"After all, this was the newest of his experiences. Sooner or later, if"
"he chose, he could escape into great, grey, formless India, beyond"
"tents and padres and colonels. Meantime, if the Sahibs were to be"
"impressed, he would do his best to impress them. He too was a white"
man.

"After much talk that he could not comprehend, they handed him over to a"
"sergeant, who had strict instructions not to let him escape. The"
"Regiment would go on to Umballa, and Kim would be sent up, partly at"
"the expense of the Lodge and in part by subscription, to a place called"
Sanawar.

"â Itâ s miraculous past all whooping, Colonel,â  said Father Victor, when"
he had talked without a break for ten minutes. â His Buddhist friend has
levanted after taking my name and address. I canâ t quite make out
whether heâ ll pay for the boyâ s education or whether he is preparing
some sort of witchcraft on his own account.â  Then to Kim: â Youâ ll live
to be grateful to your friend the Red Bull yet. Weâ ll make a man of you
at Sanawarâ even at the price oâ  making you a Protestant.â 

"â Certainlyâ most certainly,â  said Bennett."

"â But you will not go to Sanawar,â  said Kim."

"â But we will go to Sanawar, little man. Thatâ s the order of the"
"Commander-in-Chief, whoâ s a trifle more important than Oâ Haraâ s son.â "

â You will not go to Sanawar. You will go to thee War.â 

There was a shout of laughter from the full tent.

â When you know your own Regiment a trifle better you wonâ t confuse the
"line of march with line of battle, Kim. We hope to go to â€˜thee Warâ "
sometime.â 

"â Oah, I know all thatt.â  Kim drew his bow again at a venture. If they"
"were not going to the war, at least they did not know what he knew of"
the talk in the veranda at Umballa.

â I know you are not at thee war now; but I tell  you  that as soon as
you get to Umballa you will be sent to the warâ the new war. It is a war
"of eight thousand men, besides the guns.â "

â Thatâ s explicit. Dâ you add prophecy to your other gifts? Take him
"along, sergeant. Take up a suit for him from the Drums, anâ  take care"
he doesnâ t slip through your fingers. Who says the age of miracles is
gone by? I think Iâ ll go to bed. My poor mindâ s weakening.â 

"At the far end of the camp, silent as a wild animal, an hour later sat"
"Kim, newly washed all over, in a horrible stiff suit that rasped his"
arms and legs.

"â A most amazinâ  young bird,â  said the sergeant. â He turns up in charge"
"of a yellow-headed buck-Brahmin priest, with his fatherâ s Lodge"
"certificates round his neck, talkinâ  God knows what all of a red bull."
"The buck-Brahmin evaporates without explanations, anâ  the bhoy sets"
cross-legged on the Chaplainâ s bed prophesyinâ  bloody war to the men at
large. Injiaâ s a wild land for a God-fearinâ  man. Iâ ll just tie his leg
to the tent-pole in case heâ ll go through the roof. What did ye say
about the war?â 

"â Eight thousand men, besides guns,â  said Kim. â Very soon you will see.â "

â Youâ re a consolinâ  little imp. Lie down between the Drums anâ  go to
bye-bye. Those two boys will watch your slumbers.â 




CHAPTER VI


Now I remember comradesâ 
Old playmates on new seasâ 
Whenas we traded orpiment
Among the savages.
"Ten thousand leagues to southward,"
And thirty years removedâ 
"They knew not noble Valdez,"
But me they knew and loved.

 Song of Diego Valdez. 

Very early in the morning the white tents came down and disappeared as
the Mavericks took a side-road to Umballa. It did not skirt the
"resting-place, and Kim, trudging beside a baggage-cart under fire of"
"comments from soldiersâ  wives, was not so confident as overnight. He"
"discovered that he was closely watchedâ Father Victor on the one side,"
and Mr Bennett on the other.

In the forenoon the column checked. A camel-orderly handed the Colonel
"a letter. He read it, and spoke to a Major. Half a mile in the rear,"
Kim heard a hoarse and joyful clamour rolling down on him through the
"thick dust. Then someone beat him on the back, crying: â Tell us how ye"
"knew, ye little limb of Satan? Father dear, see if ye can make him"
tell.â 

"A pony ranged alongside, and he was hauled on to the priestâ s"
saddlebow.

"â Now, my son, your prophecy of last night has come true. Our orders are"
to entrain at Umballa for the Front tomorrow.â 

"â What is thatt?â  said Kim, for â  front â  and â  entrain â  were newish"
words to him.

"â We are going to â€˜thee War,â  as you called it.â "

â Of course you are going to thee War. I said last night.â 

"â Ye did; but, Powers oâ  Darkness, how did ye know?â "

"Kimâ s eyes sparkled. He shut his lips, nodded his head, and looked"
"unspeakable things. The Chaplain moved on through the dust, and"
"privates, sergeants, and subalterns called one anotherâ s attention to"
"the boy. The Colonel, at the head of the column, stared at him"
curiously. â It was probably some bazar rumour.â  he said; â but even
"thenâ â  He referred to the paper in his hand. â Hang it all, the thing"
was only decided within the last forty-eight hours.â 

"â Are there many more like you in India?â  said Father Victor, â or are"
you by way oâ  being a  lusus naturÃ¦? â 

"â Now I have told you,â  said the boy, â will you let me go back to my old"
"man? If he has not stayed with that woman from Kulu, I am afraid he"
will die.â 

â By what I saw of him heâ s as well able to take care of himself as you.
"No. Yeâ ve brought us luck, anâ  weâ re goinâ  to make a man of you. Iâ ll"
take ye back to your baggage-cart and yeâ ll come to me this evening.â 

For the rest of the day Kim found himself an object of distinguished
consideration among a few hundred white men. The story of his
"appearance in camp, the discovery of his parentage, and his prophecy,"
"had lost nothing in the telling. A big, shapeless white woman on a pile"
of bedding asked him mysteriously whether he thought her husband would
"come back from the war. Kim reflected gravely, and said that he would,"
"and the woman gave him food. In many respects, this big procession that"
played music at intervalsâ this crowd that talked and laughed so
"easilyâ resembled a festival in Lahore city. So far, there was no sign"
"of hard work, and he resolved to lend the spectacle his patronage. At"
"evening there came out to meet them bands of music, and played the"
Mavericks into camp near Umballa railway station. That was an
interesting night. Men of other regiments came to visit the Mavericks.
The Mavericks went visiting on their own account. Their pickets hurried
"forth to bring them back, met pickets of strange regiments on the same"
"duty; and, after a while, the bugles blew madly for more pickets with"
officers to control the tumult. The Mavericks had a reputation for
liveliness to live up to. But they fell in on the platform next morning
"in perfect shape and condition; and Kim, left behind with the sick,"
"women, and boys, found himself shouting farewells excitedly as the"
trains drew away. Life as a Sahib was amusing so far; but he touched it
with a cautious hand. Then they marched him back in charge of a
"drummer-boy to empty, lime-washed barracks, whose floors were covered"
"with rubbish and string and paper, and whose ceilings gave back his"
"lonely footfall. Native-fashion, he curled himself up on a stripped cot"
"and went to sleep. An angry man stumped down the veranda, woke him up,"
"and said he was a schoolmaster. This was enough for Kim, and he retired"
into his shell. He could just puzzle out the various English Police
"notices in Lahore city, because they affected his comfort; and among"
the many guests of the woman who looked after him had been a queer
German who painted scenery for the Parsee travelling theatre. He told
"Kim that he had been â on the barricades in â Forty-eight,â  and"
thereforeâ at least that was how it struck Kimâ he would teach the boy to
"write in return for food. Kim had been kicked as far as single letters,"
but did not think well of them.

"â I do not know anything. Go away!â  said Kim, scenting evil. Hereupon"
"the man caught him by the ear, dragged him to a room in a far-off wing"
"where a dozen drummer-boys were sitting on forms, and told him to be"
still if he could do nothing else. This he managed very successfully.
The man explained something or other with white lines on a black board
"for at least half an hour, and Kim continued his interrupted nap. He"
"much disapproved of the present aspect of affairs, for this was the"
very school and discipline he had spent two-thirds of his young life in
"avoiding. Suddenly a beautiful idea occurred to him, and he wondered"
that he had not thought of it before.

"The man dismissed them, and first to spring through the veranda into"
the open sunshine was Kim.

"â â Ere, you! â Alt! Stop!â  said a high voice at his heels. â Iâ ve got to"
look after you. My orders are not to let you out of my sight. Where are
you goinâ ?â 

It was the drummer-boy who had been hanging round him all the
"forenoonâ a fat and freckled person of about fourteen, and Kim loathed"
him from the soles of his boots to his cap-ribbons.

"â To the bazarâ to get sweetsâ for you,â  said Kim, after thought."

"â Well, the bazarâ s out oâ  bounds. If we go there weâ ll get a"
dressing-down. You come back.â 

"â How near can we go?â  Kim did not know what bounds meant, but he wished"
to be politeâ for the present.

"â â Ow near? â Ow far, you mean! We can go as far as that tree down the"
road.â 

â Then I will go there.â 

â All right. I ainâ t goinâ . Itâ s too â ot. I can watch you from â ere.
"Itâ s no good your runninv away. If you did, theyâ d spot you by your"
clothes. Thatâ s regimental stuff youâ re wearinâ . There ainâ t a picket
in Umballa wouldnâ t â ead you back quicker than you started out.â 

This did not impress Kim as much as the knowledge that his raiment
would tire him out if he tried to run. He slouched to the tree at the
"corner of a bare road leading towards the bazar, and eyed the natives"
passing. Most of them were barrack-servants of the lowest caste. Kim
"hailed a sweeper, who promptly retorted with a piece of unnecessary"
"insolence, in the natural belief that the European boy could not follow"
"it. The low, quick answer undeceived him. Kim put his fettered soul"
"into it, thankful for the late chance to abuse somebody in the tongue"
"he knew best. â And now, go to the nearest letter-writer in the bazar"
and tell him to come here. I would write a letter.â 

â Butâ but what manner of white manâ s son art thou to need a bazar
letter-writer? Is there not a schoolmaster in the barracks?â 

"â Ay; and Hell is full of the same sort. Do my order, youâ you Od! Thy"
mother was married under a basket! Servant of Lal Begâ  (Kim knew the
"God of the sweepers), â run on my business or we will talk again.â "

The sweeper shuffled off in haste. â There is a white boy by the
"barracks waiting under a tree who is not a white boy,â  he stammered to"
the first bazar letter-writer he came across. â He needs thee.â 

"â Will he pay?â  said the spruce scribe, gathering up his desk and pens"
and sealing-wax all in order.

â I do not know. He is not like other boys. Go and see. It is well
worth.â 

Kim danced with impatience when the slim young Kayeth hove in sight. As
soon as his voice could carry he cursed him volubly.

"â First I will take my pay,â  the letter-writer said. â Bad words have"
"made the price higher. But who art thou, dressed in that fashion, to"
speak in this fashion?â 

â Aha! That is in the letter which thou shalt write. Never was such a
tale. But I am in no haste. Another writer will serve me. Umballa city
is as full of them as is Lahore.â 

"â Four annas,â  said the writer, sitting down and spreading his cloth in"
the shade of a deserted barrack-wing.

Mechanically Kim squatted beside himâ squatted as only the natives
canâ in spite of the abominable clinging trousers.

The writer regarded him sideways.

"â That is the price to ask of Sahibs,â  said Kim. â Now fix me a true"
one.â 

"â An anna and a half. How do I know, having written the letter, that"
thou wilt not run away?â 

"I must not go beyond this tree, and there is also the stamp to be"
considered.â 

"â I get no commission on the price of the stamp. Once more, what manner"
of white boy art thou?â 

"â That shall be said in the letter, which is to Mahbub Ali, the"
"horse-dealer in the Kashmir Serai, at Lahore. He is my friend.â "

"â Wonder on wonder!â  murmured the letter-writer, dipping a reed in the"
inkstand. â To be written in Hindi?â 

â Assuredly. To Mahbub Ali then. Begin!  I have come down with the old
man as far as Umballa in the train. At Umballa I carried the news of
"the bay mareâ s pedigree. â  After what he had seen in the garden, he was"
not going to write of white stallions.

"â Slower a little. What has a bay mare to do ... Is it Mahbub Ali, the"
great dealer?â 

â Who else? I have been in his service. Take more ink. Again.  As the
"order was, so I did it. We then went on foot towards Benares, but on"
the third day we found a certain regiment.  Is that down?â 

"â Ay,  pulton ,â  murmured the writer, all ears."

"â  I went into their camp and was caught, and by means of the charm"
"about my neck, which thou knowest, it was established that I was the"
son of some man in the regiment: according to the prophecy of the Red
"Bull, which thou knowest was common talk of our bazar. â  Kim waited for"
"this shaft to sink into the letter-writerâ s heart, cleared his throat,"
and continued: â  A priest clothed me and gave me a new name ... One
"priest, however, was a fool. The clothes are very heavy, but I am a"
Sahib and my heart is heavy too. They send me to a school and beat me.
"I do not like the air and water here. Come then and help me, Mahbub"
"Ali, or send me some money, for I have not sufficient to pay the writer"
who writes this. â 

â â€˜Who writes this.â  It is my own fault that I was tricked. Thou art as
clever as Husain Bux that forged the Treasury stamps at Nucklao. But
what a tale! What a tale! Is it true by any chance?â 

â It does not profit to tell lies to Mahbub Ali. It is better to help
his friends by lending them a stamp. When the money comes I will
repay.â 

"The writer grunted doubtfully, but took a stamp out of his desk, sealed"
"the letter, handed it over to Kim, and departed. Mahbub Aliâ s was a"
name of power in Umballa.

"â That is the way to win a good account with the Gods,â  Kim shouted"
after him.

"â Pay me twice over when the money comes,â  the man cried over his"
shoulder.

â What was you bukkinâ  to that nigger about?â  said the drummer-boy when
Kim returned to the veranda. â I was watch-inâ  you.â 

â I was only talkinâ  to him.â 

"â You talk the same as a nigger, donâ t you?â "

â No-ah! No-ah! I onlee speak a little. What shall we do now?â 

â The buglesâ ll go for dinner in arf a minute. My Gawd! I wish Iâ d gone
up to the Front with the Regiment. Itâ s awful doinâ  nothinâ  but school
down â ere. Donâ t you â ate it?â 

â Oah yess!â 

"Iâ d run away if I knew where to go to, but, as the men say, in this"
bloominâ  Injia youâ re only a prisoner at large. You canâ t desert
without beinâ  took back at once. Iâ m fair sick of it.â 

â You have been in Beâ England?â 

"â Wâ y, I only come out last troopinâ  season with my mother. I should"
think I â ave been in England. What a ignorant little beggar you are!
"You was brought up in the gutter, wasnâ t you?â "

â Oah yess. Tell me something about England. My father he came from
there.â 

"Though he would not say so, Kim of course disbelieved every word the"
drummer-boy spoke about the Liverpool suburb which was his England. It
passed the heavy time till dinnerâ a most unappetizing meal served to
the boys and a few invalids in a corner of a barrack-room. But that he
"had written to Mahbub Ali, Kim would have been almost depressed. The"
indifference of native crowds he was used to; but this strong
"loneliness among white men preyed on him. He was grateful when, in the"
"course of the afternoon, a big soldier took him over to Father Victor,"
who lived in another wing across another dusty parade-ground. The
priest was reading an English letter written in purple ink. He looked
at Kim more curiously than ever.

"â Anâ  how do you like it, my son, as far as youâ ve gone? Not much, eh?"
It must be hardâ very hard on a wild animal. Listen now. Iâ ve an amazinâ 
epistle from your friend.â 

"â Where is he? Is he well? Oah! If he knows to write me letters, it is"
all right.â 

â Youâ re fond of him then?â 

â  Of  course I am fond of him. He was fond of me.â 

"â It seems so by the look of this. He canâ t write English, can he?â "

"â Oah no. Not that I know, but  of  course he found a letter-writer who"
"can write English verree well, and so he wrote. I do hope you"
understand.â 

â That accounts for it. Dâ you know anything about his money affairs?â 
Kimâ s face showed that he did not.

â How can I tell?â 

â Thatâ s what Iâ m askinâ . Now listen if you can make head or tail oâ 
this. Weâ ll skip the first part ... Itâ s written from Jagadhir Road ...

â He says he will give me three hundred rupees a year? So he will give
me them.â 

"â Oh, thatâ s the way you look at it, is it?â "

â  Of  course. If he says so!â 

The priest whistled; then he addressed Kim as an equal. â I donâ t
believe it; but weâ ll see. You were goinâ  off today to the Military
"Orphanage at Sanawar, where the Regiment would keep you till you were"
old enough to enlist. Yeâ d be brought up to the Church of England.
"Bennett arranged for that. On the other hand, if ye go to St Xavierâ s"
yeâ ll get a better education anâ an can have the religion. Dâ ye see my

train with none to beg for him.

"though I donâ t believe it at all. Even then, if he fails in his"
payments later on ... but itâ s beyond me. We can only walk one step at
"a time in this world, praise God! Anâ  they sent Bennett to the Front"
anâ  left me behind. Bennett canâ t expect everything.â 

"â Oah yess,â  said Kim vaguely."

The priest leaned forward. â Iâ d give a monthâ s pay to find whatâ s goinâ 
on inside that little round head of yours.â 

"â There is nothing,â  said Kim, and scratched it. He was wondering"
whether Mahbub Ali would send him as much as a whole rupee. Then he
could pay the letter-writer and write letters to the lama at Benares.
Perhaps Mahbub Ali would visit him next time he came south with horses.
Surely he must know that Kimâ s delivery of the letter to the officer at
Umballa had caused the great war which the men and boys had discussed
so loudly over the barrack dinner-tables. But if Mahbub Ali did not
"know this, it would be very unsafe to tell him so. Mahbub Ali was hard"
"upon boys who knew, or thought they knew, too much."

"â Well, till I get further newsâ â Father Victorâ s voice interrupted the"
reverie. â Ye can run along now and play with the other boys. Theyâ ll
teach ye somethingâ but I donâ t think yeâ ll like it.â 

The day dragged to its weary end. When he wished to sleep he was
instructed how to fold up his clothes and set out his boots; the other
boys deriding. Bugles waked him in the dawn; the schoolmaster caught
"him after breakfast, thrust a page of meaningless characters under his"
"nose, gave them senseless names and whacked him without reason. Kim"
"meditated poisoning him with opium borrowed from a barrack-sweeper, but"
"reflected that, as they all ate at one table in public (this was"
"peculiarly revolting to Kim, who preferred to turn his back on the"
"world at meals), the stroke might be dangerous. Then he attempted"
running off to the village where the priest had tried to drug the
lamaâ the village where the old soldier lived. But far-seeing sentries
at every exit headed back the little scarlet figure. Trousers and
jacket crippled body and mind alike so he abandoned the project and
"fell back, Oriental-fashion, on time and chance. Three days of torment"
"passed in the big, echoing white rooms. He walked out of afternoons"
"under escort of the drummer-boy, and all he heard from his companions"
were the few useless words which seemed to make two-thirds of the white
manâ s abuse. Kim knew and despised them all long ago. The boy resented
"his silence and lack of interest by beating him, as was only natural."
He did not care for any of the bazars which were in bounds. He styled
all natives â niggersâ ; yet servants and sweepers called him abominable
"names to his face, and, misled by their deferential attitude, he never"
understood. This somewhat consoled Kim for the beatings.

On the morning of the fourth day a judgement overtook that drummer.
They had gone out together towards Umballa racecourse. He returned
"alone, weeping, with news that young Oâ Hara, to whom he had been doing"
"nothing in particular, had hailed a scarlet-bearded nigger on"
horseback; that the nigger had then and there laid into him with a
"peculiarly adhesive quirt, picked up young Oâ Hara, and borne him off at"
"full gallop. These tidings came to Father Victor, and he drew down his"
long upper lip. He was already sufficiently startled by a letter from
"the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares, enclosing a native bankerâ s"
"note of hand for three hundred rupees, and an amazing prayer to"
â Almighty Godâ . The lama would have been more annoyed than the priest
had he known how the bazar letter-writer had translated his phrase â to
acquire merit.â 

â Powers of Darkness below!â  Father Victor fumbled with the note. â Anâ 
now heâ s off with another of his peep-oâ -day friends. I donâ t know
whether it will be a greater relief to me to get him back or to have
"him lost. Heâ s beyond my comprehension. How the Divilâ yes, heâ s the man"
I meanâ can a street-beggar raise money to educate white boys?â 

"Three miles off, on Umballa racecourse, Mahbub Ali, reining a grey"
"Kabuli stallion with Kim in front of him, was saying:"

"â But, Little Friend of all the World, there is  my  honour and"
reputation to be considered. All the officer-Sahibs in all the
"regiments, and all Umballa, know Mahbub Ali. Men saw me pick thee up"
and chastise that boy. We are seen now from far across this plain. How
"can I take thee away, or account for thy disappearing if I set thee"
down and let thee run off into the crops? They would put me in jail. Be
"patient. Once a Sahib, always a Sahib. When thou art a manâ who"
knows?â thou wilt be grateful to Mahbub Ali.â 

â Take me beyond their sentries where I can change this red. Give me
money and I will go to Benares and be with my lama again. I do not want
"to be a Sahib, and remember I did deliver that message.â "

The stallion bounded wildly. Mahbub Ali had incautiously driven home
the sharp-edged stirrup. (He was not the new sort of fluent
horse-dealer who wears English boots and spurs.) Kim drew his own
conclusions from that betrayal.

â That was a small matter. It lay on the straight road to Benares. I and
the Sahib have by this time forgotten it. I send so many letters and
"messages to men who ask questions about horses, I cannot well remember"
one from the other. Was it some matter of a bay mare that Peters Sahib
wished the pedigree of?â 

Kim saw the trap at once. If he had said â bay mareâ  Mahbub would have
known by his very readiness to fall in with the amendment that the boy
suspected something. Kim replied therefore:

â Bay mare. No.  I  do not forget my messages thus. It was a white
stallion.â 

"â Ay, so it was. A white Arab stallion. But thou didst write â€˜bay mareâ "
to me.â 

"â Who cares to tell truth to a letter-writer?â  Kim answered, feeling"
Mahbubâ s palm on his heart.

"â Hi! Mahbub, you old villain, pull up!â  cried a voice, and an"
Englishman raced alongside on a little polo-pony. â Iâ ve been chasing
"you half over the country. That Kabuli of yours can go. For sale, I"
suppose?â 

â I have some young stuff coming on made by Heaven for the delicate and
difficult polo-game. He has no equal. Heâ â 

â Plays polo and waits at table. Yes. We know all that. What the deuce
have you got there?â 

"â A. boy,â  said Mahbub gravely. â He was being beaten by another boy. His"
father was once a white soldier in the big war. The boy was a child in
Lahore city. He played with my horses when he was a babe. Now I think
they will make him a soldier. He has been newly caught by his fatherâ s
Regiment that went up to the war last week. But I do not think he wants
to be a soldier. I take him for a ride. Tell me where thy barracks are
and I will set thee there.â 

â Let me go. I can find the barracks alone.â 

â And if thou runnest away who will say it is not my fault?â 

â Heâ ll run back to his dinner. Where has he to run to?â  the Englishman
asked.

â He was born in the land. He has friends. He goes where he chooses. He
is a  chabuk sawai  (a sharp chap). It needs only to change his
"clothing, and in a twinkling he would be a low-caste Hindu boy.â "

â The deuce he would!â  The Englishman looked critically at the boy as
Mahbub headed towards the barracks. Kim ground his teeth. Mahbub was
"mocking him, as faithless Afghans will; for he went on:"

â They will send him to a school and put heavy boots on his feet and
"swaddle him in these clothes. Then he will forget all he knows. Now,"
which of the barracks is thine?â 

"Kim pointedâ he could not speakâ to Father Victorâ s wing, all staring"
white near by.

"â Perhaps he will make a good soldier,â  said Mahbub reflectively."

â He will make a good orderly at least. I sent him to deliver a message
once from Lahore. A message concerning the pedigree of a white
stallion.â 

Here was deadly insult on deadlier injuryâ and the Sahib to whom he had
so craftily given that war-waking letter heard it all. Kim beheld
"Mahbub Ali frying in flame for his treachery, but for himself he saw"
"one long grey vista of barracks, schools, and barracks again. He gazed"
imploringly at the clear-cut face in which there was no glimmer of
recognition; but even at this extremity it never occurred to him to
throw himself on the white manâ s mercy or to denounce the Afghan. And
"Mahbub stared deliberately at the Englishman, who stared as"
"deliberately at Kim, quivering and tongue-tied."

"â My horse is well trained,â  said the dealer. â Others would have kicked,"
Sahib.â 

"â Ah,â  said the Englishman at last, rubbing his ponyâ s damp withers with"
his whip-butt. â Who makes the boy a soldier?â 

"â He says the Regiment that found him, and especially the Padre-sahib of"
that regiment.

â There is the Padre!â  Kim choked as bare-headed Father Victor sailed
down upon them from the veranda.

"â Powers Oâ  Darkness below, Oâ Hara! How many more mixed friends do you"
"keep in Asia?â  he cried, as Kim slid down and stood helplessly before"
him.

"â Good morning, Padre,â  the Englishman said cheerily. â I know you by"
reputation well enough. Meant to have come over and called before this.
Iâ m Creighton.â 

â Of the Ethnological Survey?â  said Father Victor. The Englishman
"nodded. â Faith, Iâ m glad to meet ye then; anâ  I owe you some thanks for"
bringing back the boy.â 

"â No thanks to me, Padre. Besides, the boy wasnâ t going away. You donâ t"
know old Mahbub Ali.â  The horse-dealer sat impassive in the sunlight.
â You will when you have been in the station a month. He sells us all
our crocks. That boy is rather a curiosity. Can you tell me anything
about him?â 

â Can I tell you?â  puffed Father Victor. â Youâ ll be the one man that
"could help me in my quandaries. Tell you! Powers oâ  Darkness, Iâ m"
bursting to tell someone who knows something oâ  the native!â 

"A groom came round the corner. Colonel Creighton raised his voice,"
"speaking in Urdu. â Very good, Mahbub Ali, but what is the use of"
telling me all those stories about the pony? Not one pice more than
three hundred and fifty rupees will I give.â 

"â The Sahib is a little hot and angry after riding,â  the horse-dealer"
"returned, with the leer of a privileged jester. â Presently, he will see"
my horseâ s points more clearly. I will wait till he has finished his
talk with the Padre. I will wait under that tree.â 

â Confound you!â  The Colonel laughed. â That comes of looking at one of
"Mahbubâ s horses. Heâ s a regular old leech, Padre. Wait, then, if thou"
"hast so much time to spare, Mahbub. Now Iâ m at your service, Padre."
"Where is the boy? Oh, heâ s gone off to collogue with Mahbub. Queer sort"
of boy. Might I ask you to send my mare round under cover?â 

He dropped into a chair which commanded a clear view of Kim and Mahbub
Ali in conference beneath the tree. The Padre went indoors for
cheroots.

"Creighton heard Kim say bitterly: â Trust a Brahmin before a snake, and"
"a snake before an harlot, and an harlot before a Pathan, Mahbub Ali.â "

â That is all one.â  The great red beard wagged solemnly. â Children
should not see a carpet on the loom till the pattern is made plain.
"Believe me, Friend of all the World, I do thee great service. They will"
not make a soldier of thee.â 

â You crafty old sinner!â  thought Creighton. â But youâ re not far wrong.
That boy mustnâ t be wasted if he is as advertised.â 

"â Excuse me half a minute,â  cried the Padre from within, â but Iâ m"
gettinâ  the documents in the case.â 

â If through me the favour of this bold and wise Colonel Sahib comes to
"thee, and thou art raised to honour, what thanks wilt thou give Mahbub"
Ali when thou art a man?â 

"â Nay, nay! I begged thee to let me take the Road again, where I should"
have been safe; and thou hast sold me back to the English. What will
they give thee for blood-money?â 

"â A cheerful young demon!â  The Colonel bit his cigar, and turned"
politely to Father Victor.

â What are the letters that the fat priest is waving before the Colonel?
Stand behind the stallion as though looking at my bridle!â  said Mahbub
Ali.

"â A letter from my lama which he wrote from Jagadhir Road, saying that"
he will pay three hundred rupees by the year for my schooling.â 

â Oho! Is old Red Hat of that sort? At which school?â 

â God knows. I think in Nucklao.â 

â Yes. There is a big school there for the sons of Sahibsâ and
half-Sahibs. I have seen it when I sell horses there. So the lama also
loved the Friend of all the World?â 

"â Ay; and  he  did not tell lies, or return me to captivity.â "

â Small wonder the Padre does not know how to unravel the thread. How
fast he talks to the Colonel Sahib!â  Mahbub Ali chuckled. â By Allah!â 
the keen eyes swept the veranda for an Instantâ â thy lama has sent what
to me looks like a note of hand. I have had some few dealings in
 hoondies . The Colonel Sahib is looking at it.â 

"â What good is all this to me?â  said Kim wearily. â Thou wilt go away,"
and they will return me to those empty rooms where there is no good
place to sleep and where the boys beat me.â 

"â I do not think that. Have patience, child. All Pathans are not"
faithlessâ except in horseflesh.â 

"Fiveâ tenâ fifteen minutes passed, Father Victor talking energetically or"
asking questions which the Colonel answered.

â Now Iâ ve told you everything that I know about the boy from beginnin
to end; and itâ s a blessed relief to me. Did ye ever hear the like?â 

"â At any rate, the old man has sent the money. Gobind Sahaiâ s notes of"
"hand are good from here to China,â  said the Colonel. â The more one"
knows about natives the less can one say what they will or wonâ t do.â 

â Thatâ s consolinâ â from the head of the Ethnological Survey. Itâ s this
"mixture of Red Bulls and Rivers of Healing (poor heathen, God help"
"him!) anâ  notes of hand and Masonic certificates. Are you a Mason, by"
any chance?â 

"â By Jove, I am, now I come to think of it. Thatâ s an additional"
"reason,â  said the Colonel absently."

"â Iâ m glad ye see a reason in it. But as I said, itâ s the mixture oâ "
"things thatâ s beyond me. Anâ  his prophesyinâ  to our Colonel, sitting on"
my bed with his little shimmy torn open showing his white skin; anâ  the
"prophecy cominâ  true! Theyâ ll cure all that nonsense at St Xavierâ s,"
eh?â 

"â Sprinkle him with holy water,â  the Colonel laughed."

"â On my word, I fancy I ought to sometimes. But Iâ m hoping heâ ll be"
brought up as a good Catholic. All that troubles me is whatâ ll happen
if the old beggar-manâ â 

"â Lama, lama, my dear sir; and some of them are gentlemen in their own"
country.â 

"â The lama, then, fails to pay next year. Heâ s a fine business head to"
"plan on the spur of the moment, but heâ s bound to die some day. Anâ "
takinâ  a heathenâ s money to give a child a Christian educationâ â 

â But he said explicitly what he wanted. As soon as he knew the boy was
white he seems to have made his arrangements accordingly. Iâ d give a
monthâ s pay to hear how he explained it all at the Tirthankarsâ  Temple
"at Benares. Look here, Padre, I donâ t pretend to know much about"
"natives, but if he says heâ ll pay, heâ ll payâ dead or alive. I mean, his"
"heirs will assume the debt. My advice to you is, send the boy down to"
Lucknow. If your Anglican Chaplain thinks youâ ve stolen a march on
himâ â 

â Bad luck to Bennett! He was sent to the Front instead oâ  me. Doughty
certified me medically unfit. Iâ ll excommunicate Doughty if he comes
back alive! Surely Bennett ought to be content withâ â 

"â Glory, leaving you the religion. Quite so! As a matter of fact I donâ t"
think Bennett will mind. Put the blame on me. Iâ erâ strongly recommend
sending the boy to St Xavierâ s. He can go down on pass as a soldierâ s
"orphan, so the railway fare will be saved. You can buy him an outfit"
from the Regimental subscription. The Lodge will be saved the expense
"of his education, and that will put the Lodge in a good temper. Itâ s"
perfectly easy. Iâ ve got to go down to Lucknow next week. Iâ ll look
"after the boy on the wayâ give him in charge of my servants, and so on.â "

â Youâ re a good man.â 

â Not in the least. Donâ t make that mistake. The lama has sent us money
for a definite end. We canâ t very well return it. We shall have to do
"as he says. Well, thatâ s settled, isnâ t it? Shall we say that, Tuesday"
"next, youâ ll hand him over to me at the night train south? Thatâ s only"
three days. He canâ t do much harm in three days.â 

"â Itâ s a weight off my mind, butâ this thing here?â â he waved the note of"
"handâ â I donâ t know Gobind Sahai: or his bank, which may be a hole in a"
wall.â 

"â  You â ve never been a subaltern in debt. Iâ ll cash it if you like, and"
send you the vouchers in proper order.â 

â But with all your own work too! Itâ s askinâ â â 

"â Itâ s not the least trouble indeed. You see, as an ethnologist, the"
thingâ s very interesting to me. Iâ d like to make a note of it for some
Government work that Iâ m doing. The transformation of a regimental
badge like your Red Bull into a sort of fetish that the boy follows is
very interesting.â 

â But I canâ t thank you enough.â 

â Thereâ s one thing you can do. All we Ethnological men are as jealous
as jackdaws of one anotherâ s discoveries. Theyâ re of no interest to
"anyone but ourselves, of course, but you know what book-collectors are"
"like. Well, donâ t say a word, directly or indirectly, about the Asiatic"
"side of the boyâ s characterâ his adventures and his prophecy, and so on."
Iâ ll worm them out of the boy later on andâ you see?â 

â I do. Yeâ ll make a wonderful account of it. Never a word will I say to
anyone till I see it in print.â 

"â Thank you. That goes straight to an ethnologistâ s heart. Well, I must"
be getting back to my breakfast. Good Heavens! Old Mahbub here still?â 
"He raised his voice, and the horse-dealer came out from under the"
"shadow of the tree, â Well, what is it?â "

"â As regards that young horse,â  said Mahbub, â I say that when a colt is"
"born to be a polo-pony, closely following the ball without"
teachingâ when such a colt knows the game by divinationâ then I say it is
"a great wrong to break that colt to a heavy cart, Sahib!â "

"â So say I also, Mahbub. The colt will be entered for polo only. (These"
"fellows think of nothing in the world but horses, Padre.) Iâ ll see you"
"tomorrow, Mahbub, if youâ ve anything likely for sale.â "

"The dealer saluted, horseman-fashion, with a sweep of the off hand. â Be"
"patient a little, Friend of all the World,â  he whispered to the"
agonized Kim. â Thy fortune is made. In a little while thou goest to
"Nucklao, andâ here is something to pay the letter-writer. I shall see"
"thee again, I think, many times,â  and he cantered off down the road."

"â Listen to me,â  said the Colonel from the veranda, speaking in the"
"vernacular. â In three days thou wilt go with me to Lucknow, seeing and"
hearing new things all the while. Therefore sit still for three days
and do not run away. Thou wilt go to school at Lucknow.â 

â Shall I meet my Holy One there?â  Kim whimpered.

â At least Lucknow is nearer to Benares than Umballa. It may be thou
"wilt go under my protection. Mahbub Ali knows this, and he will be"
angry if thou returnest to the Road now. Rememberâ much has been told me
which I do not forget.â 

"â I will wait,â  said Kim, â but the boys will beat me.â "

Then the bugles blew for dinner.




CHAPTER VII


Unto whose use the pregnant suns are poised
With idiot moons and stars retracing stars?
Creep thou betweeneâ thy comingâ s all unnoised.
"Heaven hath her high, as Earth her baser, wars."
"Heir to these tumults, this affright, that fraye"
"(By Adamâ s, fathersâ , own, sin bound alway);"
"Peer up, draw out thy horoscope and say"
Which planet mends thy threadbare fate or mars!

Sir John Christie.

In the afternoon the red-faced schoolmaster told Kim that he had been
"â struck off the strengthâ , which conveyed no meaning to him till he was"
"ordered to go away and play. Then he ran to the bazar, and found the"
young letter-writer to whom he owed a stamp.

"â Now I pay,â  said Kim royally, â and now I need another letter to be"
written.â 

"â Mahbub Ali is in Umballa,â  said the writer jauntily. He was, by virtue"
"of his office, a bureau of general misinformation."

"â This is not to Mahbub, but to a priest. Take thy pen and write"
"quickly.  To Teshoo Lama, the Holy One from Bhotiyal seeking for a"
"River, who is now in the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares.  Take"
more ink!  In three days I am to go down to Nucklao to the school at
Nucklao. The name of the school is Xavier. I do not know where that
"school is, but it is at Nucklao. â "

"â But I know Nucklao,â  the writer interrupted. â I know the school.â "

"â Tell him where it is, and I give half an anna.â "

The reed pen scratched busily. â He cannot mistake.â  The man lifted his
head. â Who watches us across the street?â 

Kim looked up hurriedly and saw Colonel Creighton in tennis-flannels.

"â Oh, that is some Sahib who knows the fat priest in the barracks. He is"
beckoning me.â 

"â What dost thou?â  said the Colonel, when Kim trotted up."

â Iâ I am not running away. I send a letter to my Holy One at Benares.â 

â I had not thought of that. Hast thou said that I take thee to
Lucknow?â 

"â Nay, I have not. Read the letter, if there be a doubt.â "

â Then why hast thou left out my name in writing to that Holy One?â  The
Colonel smiled a queer smile. Kim took his courage in both hands.

â It was said once to me that it is inexpedient to write the names of
"strangers concerned in any matter, because by the naming of names many"
good plans are brought to confusion.â 

"â Thou hast been well taught,â  the Colonel replied, and Kim flushed. â I"
have left my cheroot-case in the Padreâ s veranda. Bring it to my house
this even.â 

â Where is the house?â  said Kim. His quick wit told him that he was
"being tested in some fashion or another, and he stood on guard."

â Ask anyone in the big bazar.â  The Colonel walked on.

"â He has forgotten his cheroot-case,â  said Kim, returning. â I must bring"
"it to him this evening. That is all my letter except, thrice over,"
 Come to me! Come to me! Come to me!  Now I will pay for a stamp and
"put it in the post. He rose to go, and as an afterthought asked: â Who"
is that angry-faced Sahib who lost the cheroot-case?â 

"â Oh, he is only Creighton Sahibâ a very foolish Sahib, who is a Colonel"
Sahib without a regiment.â 

â What is his business?â 

"â God knows. He is always buying horses which he cannot ride, and asking"
riddles about the works of Godâ such as plants and stones and the
"customs of people. The dealers call him the father of fools, because he"
is so easily cheated about a horse. Mahbub Ali says he is madder than
most other Sahibs.â 

"â Oh!â  said Kim, and departed. His training had given him some small"
"knowledge of character, and he argued that fools are not given"
information which leads to calling out eight thousand men besides guns.
"The Commander-in-Chief of all India does not talk, as Kim had heard him"
"talk, to fools. Nor would Mahbub Aliâ s tone have changed, as it did"
"every time he mentioned the Colonelâ s name, if the Colonel had been a"
fool. Consequentlyâ and this set Kim to skippingâ there was a mystery
"somewhere, and Mahbub Ali probably spied for the Colonel much as Kim"
"had spied for Mahbub. And, like the horse-dealer, the Colonel evidently"
respected people who did not show themselves to be too clever.

He rejoiced that he had not betrayed his knowledge of the Colonelâ s
"house; and when, on his return to barracks, he discovered that no"
"cheroot-case had been left behind, he beamed with delight. Here was a"
man after his own heartâ a tortuous and indirect person playing a hidden
"game. Well, if he could be a fool, so could Kim."

"He showed nothing of his mind when Father Victor, for three long"
"mornings, discoursed to him of an entirely new set of Gods and"
"Godlingsâ notably of a Goddess called Mary, who, he gathered, was one"
"with Bibi Miriam of Mahbub Aliâ s theology. He betrayed no emotion when,"
"after the lecture, Father Victor dragged him from shop to shop buying"
"articles of outfit, nor when envious drummer-boys kicked him because he"
"was going to a superior school did he complain, but awaited the play of"
"circumstances with an interested soul. Father Victor, good man, took"
"him to the station, put him into an empty second-class next to Colonel"
"Creightonâ s first, and bade him farewell with genuine feeling."

"â Theyâ ll make a man oâ  you, Oâ Hara, at St Xavierâ sâ a white man, anâ , I"
"hope, a good man. They know all about your cominâ , anâ  the Colonel will"
see that yeâ re not lost or mislaid anywhere on the road. Iâ ve given you
"a notion of religious matters,â at least I hope so,â and youâ ll remember,"
"when they ask you your religion, that youâ re a Cathâ lic. Better say"
"Roman Cathâ lic, thoâ  Iâ m not fond of the word.â "

Kim lit a rank cigaretteâ he had been careful to buy a stock in the
bazarâ and lay down to think. This solitary passage was very different
from that joyful down-journey in the third-class with the lama. â Sahibs
"get little pleasure of travel,â  he reflected. â  Hai mai!  I go from one"
place to another as it might be a kickball. It is my  Kismet . No man
"can escape his  Kismet . But I am to pray to Bibi Miriam, and I am a"
Sahib.â  He looked at his boots ruefully. â No; I am Kim. This is the
"great world, and I am only Kim. Who is Kim?â  He considered his own"
"identity, a thing he had never done before, till his head swam. He was"
"one insignificant person in all this roaring whirl of India, going"
southward to he knew not what fate.

"Presently the Colonel sent for him, and talked for a long time. So far"
"as Kim could gather, he was to be diligent and enter the Survey of"
"India as a chain-man. If he were very good, and passed the proper"
"examinations, he would be earning thirty rupees a month at seventeen"
"years old, and Colonel Creighton would see that he found suitable"
employment.

Kim pretended at first to understand perhaps one word in three of this
"talk. Then the Colonel, seeing his mistake, turned to fluent and"
picturesque Urdu and Kim was contented. No man could be a fool who knew
"the language so intimately, who moved so gently and silently, and whose"
eyes were so different from the dull fat eyes of other Sahibs.

"â Yes, and thou must learn how to make pictures of roads and mountains"
"and rivers, to carry these pictures in thine eye till a suitable time"
"comes to set them upon paper. Perhaps some day, when thou art a"
"chain-man, I may say to thee when we are working together: â€˜Go across"
those hills and see what lies beyond.â  Then one will say: â€˜There are
bad people living in those hills who will slay the chain-man if he be
seen to look like a Sahib.â  What then?â 

Kim thought. Would it be safe to return the Colonelâ s lead?

â I would tell what that other man had said.â 

â But if I answered: â€˜I will give thee a hundred rupees for knowledge of
what is behind those hillsâ for a picture of a river and a little news
of what the people say in the villages thereâ ?â 

"â How can I tell? I am only a boy. Wait till I am a man.â  Then, seeing"
"the Colonelâ s brow clouded, he went on: â But I think I should in a few"
days earn the hundred rupees.â 

â By what road?â 

"Kim shook his head resolutely. â If I said how I would earn them,"
another man might hear and forestall me. It is not good to sell
knowledge for nothing.â 

â Tell now.â  The Colonel held up a rupee. Kimâ s hand half reached
"towards it, and dropped."

"â Nay, Sahib; nay. I know the price that will be paid for the answer,"
but I do not know why the question is asked.â 

"â Take it for a gift, then,â  said Creighton, tossing it over. â There is"
a good spirit in thee. Do not let it be blunted at St Xavierâ s. There
are many boys there who despise the black men.â 

"â Their mothers were bazar-women,â  said Kim. He knew well there is no"
hatred like that of the half-caste for his brother-in-law.

"â True; but thou art a Sahib and the son of a Sahib. Therefore, do not"
at any time be led to contemn the black men. I have known boys newly
entered into the service of the Government who feigned not to
understand the talk or the customs of black men. Their pay was cut for
ignorance. There is no sin so great as ignorance. Remember this.â 

Several times in the course of the long twenty-four hoursâ  run south
"did the Colonel send for Kim, always developing this latter text."

"â We be all on one lead-rope, then,â  said Kim at last, â the Colonel,"
"Mahbub Ali, and Iâ when I become a chain-man. He will use me as Mahbub"
"Ali employed me, I think. That is good, if it allows me to return to"
the Road again. This clothing grows no easier by wear.â 

When they came to the crowded Lucknow station there was no sign of the
"lama. He swallowed his disappointment, while the Colonel bundled him"
into a  ticca-gharri  with his neat belongings and despatched him alone
to St Xavierâ s.

"â I do not say farewell, because we shall meet again,â  he cried. â Again,"
"and many times, if thou art one of good spirit. But thou art not yet"
tried.â 

â Not when I brought theeâ â Kim actually dared to use the  tum  of
equalsâ â a white stallionâ s pedigree that night?â 

"â Much is gained by forgetting, little brother,â  said the Colonel, with"
a look that pierced through Kimâ s shoulder-blades as he scuttled into
the carriage.

It took him nearly five minutes to recover. Then he sniffed the new air
"appreciatively. â A rich city,â  he said. â Richer than Lahore. How good"
"the bazars must be! Coachman, drive me a little through the bazars"
here.â 

"â My order is to take thee to the school.â  The driver used the â thouâ ,"
which is rudeness when applied to a white man. In the clearest and most
"fluent vernacular Kim pointed out his error, climbed on to the"
"box-seat, and, perfect understanding established, drove for a couple of"
"hours up and down, estimating, comparing, and enjoying. There is no"
"cityâ except Bombay, the queen of allâ more beautiful in her garish style"
"than Lucknow, whether you see her from the bridge over the river, or"
from the top of the Imambara looking down on the gilt umbrellas of the
"Chutter Munzil, and the trees in which the town is bedded. Kings have"
"adorned her with fantastic buildings, endowed her with charities,"
"crammed her with pensioners, and drenched her with blood. She is the"
"centre of all idleness, intrigue, and luxury, and shares with Delhi the"
claim to talk the only pure Urdu.

"â A fair cityâ a beautiful city.â  The driver, as a Lucknow man, was"
"pleased with the compliment, and told Kim many astounding things where"
an English guide would have talked of the Mutiny.

"â Now we will go to the school,â  said Kim at last. The great old school"
"of St Xavierâ s in Partibus, block on block of low white buildings,"
"stands in vast grounds over against the Gumti River, at some distance"
from the city.

â What like of folk are they within?â  said Kim.

"â Young Sahibsâ all devils. But to speak truth, and I drive many of them"
"to and fro from the railway station, I have never seen one that had in"
him the making of a more perfect devil than thouâ this young Sahib whom
I am now driving.â 

"Naturally, for he was never trained to consider them in any way"
"improper, Kim had passed the time of day with one or two frivolous"
"ladies at upper windows in a certain street, and naturally, in the"
"exchange of compliments, had acquitted himself well. He was about to"
"acknowledge the driverâ s last insolence, when his eyeâ it was growing"
duskâ caught a figure sitting by one of the white plaster gate-pillars
in the long sweep of wall.

â Stop!â  he cried. â Stay here. I do not go to the school at once.â 

â But what is to pay me for this coming and re-coming?â  said the driver
petulantly. â Is the boy mad? Last time it was a dancing-girl. This time
it is a priest.â 

"Kim was in the road headlong, patting the dusty feet beneath the dirty"
yellow robe.

"â I have waited here a day and a half,â  the lamaâ s level voice began."
"â Nay, I had a disciple with me. He that was my friend at the Temple of"
the Tirthankars gave me a guide for this journey. I came from Benares
"in the  te-rain , when thy letter was given me. Yes, I am well fed. I"
need nothing.â 

"â But why didst thou not stay with the Kulu woman, O Holy One? In what"
way didst thou get to Benares? My heart has been heavy since we
parted.â 

â The woman wearied me by constant flux of talk and requiring charms for
"children. I separated myself from that company, permitting her to"
"acquire merit by gifts. She is at least a woman of open hands, and I"
"made a promise to return to her house if need arose. Then, perceiving"
"myself alone in this great and terrible world, I bethought me of the"
" te-rain  to Benares, where I knew one abode in the Tirthankarsâ  Temple"
"who was a Seeker, even as I.â "

"â Ah! Thy River,â  said Kim. â I had forgotten the River.â "

"â So soon, my  chela?  I have never forgotten it. But when I had left"
"thee it seemed better that I should go to the Temple and take counsel,"
"for, look you, India is very large, and it may be that wise men before"
"us, some two or three, have left a record of the place of our River."
There is debate in the Temple of the Tirthankars on this matter; some
"saying one thing, and some another. They are courteous folk.â "

â So be it; but what dost thou do now?â 

"â I acquire merit in that I help thee, my  chela , to wisdom. The priest"
of that body of men who serve the Red Bull wrote me that all should be
"as I desired for thee. I sent the money to suffice for one year, and"
"then I came, as thou seest me, to watch for thee going up into the"
"Gates of Learning. A day and a half have I waited, not because I was"
"led by any affection towards theeâ that is no part of the Wayâ but, as"
"they said at the Tirthankarsâ  Temple, because, money having been paid"
"for learning, it was right that I should oversee the end of the matter."
"They resolved my doubts most clearly. I had a fear that, perhaps, I"
came because I wished to see theeâ misguided by the Red Mist of
"affection. It is not so ... Moreover, I am troubled by a dream.â "

"â But surely, Holy One, thou hast not forgotten the Road and all that"
befell on it. Surely it was a little to see me that thou didst come?â 

"â The horses are cold, and it is past their feeding-time,â  whined the"
driver.

â Go to Jehannum and abide there with thy reputationless aunt!â  Kim
snarled over his shoulder. â I am all alone in this land; I know not
where I go nor what shall befall me. My heart was in that letter I sent
"thee. Except for Mahbub Ali, and he is a Pathan, I have no friend save"
"thee, Holy One. Do not altogether go away.â "

"â I have considered that also,â  the lama replied, in a shaking voice."
â It is manifest that from time to time I shall acquire merit if before
that I have not found my Riverâ by assuring myself that thy feet are set
"on wisdom. What they will teach thee I do not know, but the priest"
wrote me that no son of a Sahib in all India will be better taught than
"thou. So from time to time, therefore, I will come again. Maybe thou"
wilt be such a Sahib as he who gave me these spectaclesâ â the lama wiped
"them elaboratelyâ â in the Wonder House at Lahore. That is my hope, for"
"he was a Fountain of Wisdomâ wiser than many abbots .... Again, maybe"
thou wilt forget me and our meetings.â 

"â If I eat thy bread,â  cried Kim passionately, â how shall I ever forget"
thee?â 

â Noâ no.â  He put the boy aside. â I must go back to Benares. From time to
"time, now that I know the customs of letter-writers in this land, I"
"will send thee a letter, and from time to time I will come and see"
thee.â 

"â But whither shall I send my letters?â  wailed Kim, clutching at the"
"robe, all forgetful that he was a Sahib."

â To the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares. That is the place I have
"chosen till I find my River. Do not weep; for, look you, all Desire is"
Illusion and a new binding upon the Wheel. Go up to the Gates of
"Learning. Let me see thee go ... Dost thou love me? Then go, or my"
heart cracks ... I will come again. Surely I will come again.

"The lama watched the  ticca-gharri  rumble into the compound, and"
"strode off, snuffing between each long stride."

â The Gates of Learningâ  shut with a clang.

"The country born and bred boy has his own manners and customs, which do"
not resemble those of any other land; and his teachers approach him by
"roads which an English master would not understand. Therefore, you"
would scarcely be interested in Kimâ s experiences as a St Xavierâ s boy
"among two or three hundred precocious youths, most of whom had never"
seen the sea. He suffered the usual penalties for breaking out of
bounds when there was cholera in the city. This was before he had
"learned to write fair English, and so was obliged to find a bazar"
"letter-writer. He was, of course, indicted for smoking and for the use"
of abuse more full-flavoured than even St Xavierâ s had ever heard. He
learned to wash himself with the Levitical scrupulosity of the
"native-born, who in his heart considers the Englishman rather dirty. He"
played the usual tricks on the patient coolies pulling the punkahs in
the sleeping-rooms where the boys threshed through the hot nights
telling tales till the dawn; and quietly he measured himself against
his self-reliant mates.

"They were sons of subordinate officials in the Railway, Telegraph, and"
"Canal Services; of warrant-officers, sometimes retired and sometimes"
acting as commanders-in-chief to a feudatory Rajahâ s army; of captains
"of the Indian Marine Government pensioners, planters, Presidency"
"shopkeepers, and missionaries. A few were cadets of the old Eurasian"
"houses that have taken strong root in Dhurrumtollahâ Pereiras, De"
"Souzas, and Dâ Silvas. Their parents could well have educated them in"
"England, but they loved the school that had served their own youth, and"
generation followed sallow-hued generation at St Xavierâ s. Their homes
ranged from Howrah of the railway people to abandoned cantonments like
Monghyr and Chunar; lost tea-gardens Shillong-way; villages where their
fathers were large landholders in Oudh or the Deccan; Mission-stations
"a week from the nearest railway line; seaports a thousand miles south,"
facing the brazen Indian surf; and cinchona-plantations south of all.
"The mere story of their adventures, which to them were no adventures,"
on their road to and from school would have crisped a Western boyâ s
hair. They were used to jogging off alone through a hundred miles of
"jungle, where there was always the delightful chance of being delayed"
by tigers; but they would no more have bathed in the English Channel in
an English August than their brothers across the world would have lain
still while a leopard snuffed at their palanquin. There were boys of
fifteen who had spent a day and a half on an islet in the middle of a
"flooded river, taking charge, as by right, of a camp of frantic"
pilgrims returning from a shrine. There were seniors who had
"requisitioned a chance-met Rajahâ s elephant, in the name of St Francis"
"Xavier, when the Rains once blotted out the cart-track that led to"
"their fatherâ s estate, and had all but lost the huge beast in a"
"quicksand. There was a boy who, he said, and none doubted, had helped"
his father to beat off with rifles from the veranda a rush of Akas in
the days when those head-hunters were bold against lonely plantations.

"And every tale was told in the even, passionless voice of the"
"native-born, mixed with quaint reflections, borrowed unconsciously from"
"native foster-mothers, and turns of speech that showed they had been"
"that instant translated from the vernacular. Kim watched, listened, and"
"approved. This was not insipid, single-word talk of drummer-boys. It"
dealt with a life he knew and in part understood. The atmosphere suited
"him, and he throve by inches. They gave him a white drill suit as the"
"weather warmed, and he rejoiced in the new-found bodily comforts as he"
rejoiced to use his sharpened mind over the tasks they set him. His
quickness would have delighted an English master; but at St Xavierâ s
"they know the first rush of minds developed by sun and surroundings, as"
they know the half-collapse that sets in at twenty-two or twenty-three.

None the less he remembered to hold himself lowly. When tales were told
"of hot nights, Kim did not sweep the board with his reminiscences; for"
St Xavierâ s looks down on boys who â go native all-together.â  One must
"never forget that one is a Sahib, and that some day, when examinations"
"are passed, one will command natives. Kim made a note of this, for he"
began to understand where examinations led.

Then came the holidays from August to Octoberâ the long holidays imposed
by the heat and the Rains. Kim was informed that he would go north to
"some station in the hills behind Umballa, where Father Victor would"
arrange for him.

"â A barrack-school?â  said Kim, who had asked many questions and thought"
more.

"â Yes, I suppose so,â  said the master. â It will not do you any harm to"
keep you out of mischief. You can go up with young De Castro as far as
Delhi.â 

"Kim considered it in every possible light. He had been diligent, even"
as the Colonel advised. A boyâ s holiday was his own propertyâ of so much
"the talk of his companions had advised him,â and a barrack-school would"
be torment after St Xavierâ s. Moreoverâ this was magic worth anything
elseâ he could write. In three months he had discovered how men can
"speak to each other without a third party, at the cost of half an anna"
"and a little knowledge. No word had come from the lama, but there"
remained the Road. Kim yearned for the caress of soft mud squishing up
"between the toes, as his mouth watered for mutton stewed with butter"
"and cabbages, for rice speckled with strong scented cardamoms, for the"
"saffron-tinted rice, garlic and onions, and the forbidden greasy"
sweetmeats of the bazars. They would feed him raw beef on a platter at
"the barrack-school, and he must smoke by stealth. But again, he was a"
"Sahib and was at St Xavierâ s, and that pig Mahbub Ali ... No, he would"
not test Mahbubâ s hospitalityâ and yet ... He thought it out alone in
"the dormitory, and came to the conclusion he had been unjust to Mahbub."

The school was empty; nearly all the masters had gone away; Colonel
"Creightonâ s railway pass lay in his hand, and Kim puffed himself that"
he had not spent Colonel Creightonâ s or Mahbubâ s money in riotous
living. He was still lord of two rupees seven annas. His new
"bullock-trunk, marked â K. Oâ H.â , and bedding-roll lay in the empty"
sleeping-room.

"â Sahibs are always tied to their baggage,â  said Kim, nodding at them."
"â You will stay hereâ  He went out into the warm rain, smiling sinfully,"
and sought a certain house whose outside he had noted down some time
before...

"â Arreâ ! Dost thou know what manner of women we be in this quarter? Oh,"
shame!â 

â Was I born yesterday?â  Kim squatted native-fashion on the cushions of
that upper room. â A little dyestuff and three yards of cloth to help
out a jest. Is it much to ask?â 

"â Who is  she?  Thou art full young, as Sahibs go, for this devilry.â "

"â Oh, she? She is the daughter of a certain schoolmaster of a regiment"
in the cantonments. He has beaten me twice because I went over their
wall in these clothes. Now I would go as a gardenerâ s boy. Old men are
very jealous.â 

â That is true. Hold thy face still while I dab on the juice.â 

"â Not too black,  Naikan . I would not appear to her as a  hubshi "
(nigger).â 

"â Oh, love makes nought of these things. And how old is she?â "

"â Twelve years, I think,â  said the shameless Kim. â Spread it also on the"
"breast. It may be her father will tear my clothes off me, and if I am"
piebaldâ â  he laughed.

"The girl worked busily, dabbing a twist of cloth into a little saucer"
of brown dye that holds longer than any walnut-juice.

"â Now send out and get me a cloth for the turban. Woe is me, my head is"
all unshaved! And he will surely knock off my turban.â 

"â I am not a barber, but I will make shift. Thou wast born to be a"
"breaker of hearts! All this disguise for one evening? Remember, the"
stuff does not wash away.â  She shook with laughter till her bracelets
and anklets jingled. â But who is to pay me for this? Huneefa herself
could not have given thee better stuff.â 

"â Trust in the Gods, my sister,â  said Kim gravely, screwing his face"
"round as the stain dried. â Besides, hast thou ever helped to paint a"
Sahib thus before?â 

â Never indeed. But a jest is not money.â 

â It is worth much more.â 

"â Child, thou art beyond all dispute the most shameless son of Shaitan"
"that I have ever known to take up a poor girlâ s time with this play,"
and then to say: â€˜Is not the jest enough?â  Thou wilt go very far in
this world.â  She gave the dancing-girlsâ  salutation in mockery.

â All one. Make haste and rough-cut my head.â  Kim shifted from foot to
"foot, his eyes ablaze with mirth as he thought of the fat days before"
"him. He gave the girl four annas, and ran down the stairs in the"
likeness of a low-caste Hindu boyâ perfect in every detail. A cookshop
"was his next point of call, where he feasted in extravagance and greasy"
luxury.

"On Lucknow station platform he watched young De Castro, all covered"
"with prickly-heat, get into a second-class compartment. Kim patronized"
"a third, and was the life and soul of it. He explained to the company"
that he was assistant to a juggler who had left him behind sick with
"fever, and that he would pick up his master at Umballa. As the"
"occupants of the carriage changed, he varied this tale, or adorned it"
"with all the shoots of a budding fancy, the more rampant for being held"
off native speech so long. In all India that night was no human being
"so joyful as Kim. At Umballa he got out and headed eastward, plashing"
over the sodden fields to the village where the old soldier lived.

About this time Colonel Creighton at Simla was advised from Lucknow by
wire that young Oâ Hara had disappeared. Mahbub Ali was in town selling
"horses, and to him the Colonel confided the affair one morning"
cantering round Annandale racecourse.

"â Oh, that is nothing,â  said the horse-dealer. â Men are like horses. At"
"certain times they need salt, and if that salt is not in the mangers"
they will lick it up from the earth. He has gone back to the Road again
for a while. The  madrissah  wearied him. I knew it would. Another
"time, I will take him upon the Road myself. Do not be troubled,"
"Creighton Sahib. It is as though a polo-pony, breaking loose, ran out"
to learn the game alone.â 

"â Then he is not dead, think you?â "

â Fever might kill him. I do not fear for the boy otherwise. A monkey
does not fall among trees.â 

"Next morning, on the same course, Mahbubâ s stallion ranged alongside"
the Colonel.

"â It is as I had thought,â  said the horse-dealer. â He has come through"
"Umballa at least, and there he has written a letter to me, having"
learned in the bazar that I was here.â 

"â Read,â  said the Colonel, with a sigh of relief. It was absurd that a"
man of his position should take an interest in a little country-bred
"vagabond; but the Colonel remembered the conversation in the train, and"
"often in the past few months had caught himself thinking of the queer,"
"silent, self-possessed boy. His evasion, of course, was the height of"
"insolence, but it argued some resource and nerve."

Mahbubâ s eyes twinkled as he reined out into the centre of the cramped
"little plain, where none could come near unseen."

"â â€˜ The Friend of the Stars, who is the Friend of all the World â â â "

â What is this?â 

â A name we give him in Lahore city. â€˜ The Friend of all the World takes
leave to go to his own places. He will come back upon the appointed
day. Let the box and the bedding-roll be sent for; and if there has
"been a fault, let the Hand of Friendship turn aside the Whip of"
"Calamity. â  There is yet a little more, butâ â "

"â No matter, read.â "

â â€˜ Certain things are not known to those who eat with forks. It is
better to eat with both hands for a while. Speak soft words to those
who do not understand this that the return may be propitious. â  Now the
"manner in which that was cast is, of course, the work of the"
"letter-writer, but see how wisely the boy has devised the matter of it"
so that no hint is given except to those who know!â 

â Is this the Hand of Friendship to avert the Whip of Calamity?â  laughed
the Colonel.

"â See how wise is the boy. He would go back to the Road again, as I"
said. Not knowing yet thy tradeâ â 

"â I am not at all sure of that,â  the Colonel muttered."

â He turns to me to make a peace between you. Is he not wise? He says he
"will return. He is but perfecting his knowledge. Think, Sahib! He has"
been three months at the school. And he is not mouthed to that bit. For
"my part, I rejoice. The pony learns the game.â "

"â Ay, but another time he must not go alone.â "

â Why? He went alone before he came under the Colonel Sahibâ s
"protection. When he comes to the Great Game he must go aloneâ alone, and"
"at peril of his head.  Then , if he spits, or sneezes, or sits down"
"other than as the people do whom he watches, he may be slain. Why"
hinder him now? Remember how the Persians say: The jackal that lives in
the wilds of Mazanderan can only be caught by the hounds of
Mazanderan.â 

"â True. It is true, Mahbub Ali. And if he comes to no harm, I do not"
desire anything better. But it is great insolence on his part.â 

"â He does not tell me, even, whither he goes,â  said Mahbub. â He is no"
fool. When his time is accomplished he will come to me. It is time the
healer of pearls took him in hand. He ripens too quicklyâ as Sahibs
reckon.â 

This prophecy was fulfilled to the letter a month later. Mahbub had
"gone down to Umballa to bring up a fresh consignment of horses, and Kim"
"met him on the Kalka road at dusk riding alone, begged an alms of him,"
"was sworn at, and replied in English. There was nobody within earshot"
to hear Mahbubâ s gasp of amazement.

â Oho! And where hast thou been?â 

â Up and downâ down and up.â 

"â Come under a tree, out of the wet, and tell.â "

â I stayed for a while with an old man near Umballa; anon with a
household of my acquaintance in Umballa. With one of these I went as
far as Delhi to the southward. That is a wondrous city. Then I drove a
bullock for a  teli  (an oilman) coming north; but I heard of a great
"feast forward in Patiala, and thither went I in the company of a"
firework-maker. It was a great feastâ  (Kim rubbed his stomach). â I saw
"Rajahs, and elephants with gold and silver trappings; and they lit all"
"the fireworks at once, whereby eleven men were killed, my"
"fire-work-maker among them, and I was blown across a tent but took no"
"harm. Then I came back to the  rÃªl  with a Sikh horseman, to whom I was"
groom for my bread; and so here.â 

â  Shabash! â  said Mahbub Ali.

â But what does the Colonel Sahib say? I do not wish to be beaten.â 

â The Hand of Friendship has averted the Whip of Calamity; but another
"time, when thou takest the Road it will be with me. This is too early.â "

â Late enough for me. I have learned to read and to write English a
little at the  madrissah . I shall soon be altogether a Sahib.â 

"â Hear him!â  laughed Mahbub, looking at the little drenched figure"
"dancing in the wet. â Salaamâ Sahib,â  and he saluted ironically."

"â Well, art tired of the Road, or wilt thou come on to Umballa with me"
and work back with the horses?â 

"â I come with thee, Mahbub Ali.â "




CHAPTER VIII


Something I owe to the soil that grewâ 
More to the life that fedâ 
But most to Allah Who gave me two
Separate sides to my head.

"I would go without shirts or shoes,"
"Friends, tobacco or bread"
Sooner than for an instant lose
Either side of my head.â 

"â Then in Godâ s name take blue for red,â  said Mahbub, alluding to the"
Hindu colour of Kimâ s disreputable turban.

"Kim countered with the old proverb, â I will change my faith and my"
"bedding, but  thou  must pay for it.â "

The dealer laughed till he nearly fell from his horse. At a shop on the
"outskirts of the city the change was made, and Kim stood up, externally"
"at least, a Mohammedan."

"Mahbub hired a room over against the railway station, sent for a cooked"
meal of the finest with the almond-curd sweet-meats ( balushai  we call
it) and fine-chopped Lucknow tobacco.

"â This is better than some other meat that I ate with the Sikh,â  said"
"Kim, grinning as he squatted, â and assuredly they give no such victuals"
at my  madrissah .â 

â I have a desire to hear of that same  madrissah .â  Mahbub stuffed
himself with great boluses of spiced mutton fried in fat with cabbage
"and golden-brown onions. â But tell me first, altogether and truthfully,"
"the manner of thy escape. For, O Friend of all the World,â â he loosed"
his cracking beltâ â I do not think it is often that a Sahib and the son
of a Sahib runs away from there.â 

"â How should they? They do not know the land. It was nothing,â  said Kim,"
and began his tale. When he came to the disguisement and the interview
"with the girl in the bazar, Mahbub Aliâ s gravity went from him. He"
laughed aloud and beat his hand on his thigh.

"â  Shabash! Shabash!  Oh, well done, little one! What will the healer of"
"turquoises say to this? Now, slowly, let us hear what befell"
"afterwardsâ step by step, omitting nothing.â "

"Step by step then, Kim told his adventures between coughs as the"
full-flavoured tobacco caught his lungs.

"â I said,â  growled Mahbub Ali to himself, â I  said  it was the pony"
breaking out to play polo. The fruit is ripe alreadyâ except that he
"must learn his distances and his pacings, and his rods and his"
compasses. Listen now. I have turned aside the Colonelâ s whip from thy
"skin, and that is no small service.â "

â True.â  Kim pulled serenely. â That is true.â 

â But it is not to be thought that this running out and in is any way
good.â 

"â It was my holiday, Hajji. I was a slave for many weeks. Why should I"
"not run away when the school was shut? Look, too, how I, living upon my"
"friends or working for my bread, as I did with the Sikh, have saved the"
Colonel Sahib a great expense.â 

Mahbubâ s lips twitched under his well-pruned Mohammedan moustache.

â What are a few rupeesâ â the Pathan threw out his open hand
"carelesslyâ â to the Colonel Sahib? He spends them for a purpose, not in"
any way for love of thee.â 

"â That,â  said Kim slowly, â I knew a very long time ago.â "

â Who told?â 

"â The Colonel Sahib himself. Not in those many words, but plainly enough"
"for one who is not altogether a mud-head. Yea, he told me in the"
 te-rain  when we went down to Lucknow.â 

"â Be it so. Then I will tell thee more, Friend of all the World, though"
in the telling I lend thee my head.â 

"â It was forfeit to me,â  said Kim, with deep relish, â in Umballa, when"
thou didst pick me up on the horse after the drummer-boy beat me.â 

â Speak a little plainer. All the world may tell lies save thou and I.
For equally is thy life forfeit to me if I chose to raise my finger
here.â 

"â And this is known to me also,â  said Kim, readjusting the live"
"charcoal-ball on the weed. â It is a very sure tie between us. Indeed,"
thy hold is surer even than mine; for who would miss a boy beaten to
"death, or, it may be, thrown into a well by the roadside? Most people"
"here and in Simla and across the passes behind the Hills would, on the"
"other hand, say: â€˜What has come to Mahbub Ali?â  if he were found dead"
"among his horses. Surely, too, the Colonel Sahib would make inquiries."
"But again,â â Kimâ s face puckered with cunning,â â he would not make"
"overlong inquiry, lest people should ask: â€˜What has this Colonel Sahib"
to do with that horse-dealer?â  But Iâ if I livedâ â 

â As thou wouldst surely dieâ â 

"â It may be; but I say,  if  I lived, I, and I alone, would know that"
"one had come by night, as a common thief perhaps, to Mahbub Aliâ s"
"bulkhead in the serai, and there had slain him, either before or after"
that thief had made a full search into his saddlebags and between the
"soles of his slippers. Is that news to tell to the Colonel, or would he"
say to meâ (I have not forgotten when he sent me back for a cigar-case
that he had  not  left behind him)â â€˜What is Mahbub Ali to me?â ?â 

Up went a gout of heavy smoke. There was a long pause: then Mahbub Ali
"spoke in admiration: â And with these things on thy mind, dost thou lie"
down and rise again among all the Sahibsâ  little sons at the
 madrissah  and meekly take instruction from thy teachers?â 

"â It is an order,â  said Kim blandly. â Who am I to dispute an order?â "

"â A most finished Son of Eblis,â  said Mahbub Ali. â But what is this tale"
of the thief and the search?â 

"â That which I saw,â  said Kim, â the night that my lama and I lay next"
"thy place in the Kashmir Seral. The door was left unlocked, which I"
"think is not thy custom, Mahbub. He came in as one assured that thou"
wouldst not soon return. My eye was against a knot-hole in the plank.
"He searched as it were for somethingâ not a rug, not stirrups, nor a"
"bridle, nor brass potsâ something little and most carefully hid. Else"
why did he prick with an iron between the soles of thy slippers?â 

"â Ha!â  Mahbub Ali smiled gently. â And seeing these things, what tale"
"didst thou fashion to thyself, Well of the Truth?â "

"â None. I put my hand upon my amulet, which lies always next to my skin,"
"and, remembering the pedigree of a white stallion that I had bitten out"
"of a piece of Mussalmani bread, I went away to Umballa perceiving that"
"a heavy trust was laid upon me. At that hour, had I chosen, thy head"
"was forfeit. It needed only to say to that man, â€˜I have here a paper"
concerning a horse which I cannot read.â  And then?â  Kim peered at
Mahbub under his eyebrows.

"â Then thou wouldst have drunk water twiceâ perhaps thrice, afterwards. I"
"do not think more than thrice,â  said Mahbub simply."

"â It is true. I thought of that a little, but most I thought that I"
"loved thee, Mahbub. Therefore I went to Umballa, as thou knowest, but"
(and this thou dost not know) I lay hid in the garden-grass to see what
Colonel Creighton Sahib might do upon reading the white stallionâ s
pedigree.â 

â And what did he?â  for Kim had bitten off the conversation.

"â Dost  thou  give news for love, or dost thou sell it?â  Kim asked."

â I sell andâ I buy.â  Mahbub took a four-anna piece out of his belt and
held it up.

"â Eight!â  said Kim, mechanically following the huckster instinct of the"
East.

"Mahbub laughed, and put away the coin. â It is too easy to deal in that"
"market, Friend of all the World. Tell me for love. Our lives lie in"
each otherâ s hand.â 

â Very good. I saw the Jang-i-Lat Sahib [the Commander-in-Chief] come to
a big dinner. I saw him in Creighton Sahibâ s office. I saw the two read
the white stallionâ s pedigree. I heard the very orders given for the
opening of a great war.â 

â Hah!â  Mahbub nodded with deepest eyes afire. â The game is well played.
"That war is done now, and the evil, we hope, nipped before the"
flowerâ thanks to meâ and thee. What didst thou later?â 

â I made the news as it were a hook to catch me victual and honour among
the villagers in a village whose priest drugged my lama. But I bore
"away the old manâ s purse, and the Brahmin found nothing. So next"
morning he was angry. Ho! Ho! And I also used the news when I fell into
the hands of that white Regiment with their Bull!â 

â That was foolishness.â  Mahbub scowled. â News is not meant to be thrown
"about like dung-cakes, but used sparinglyâ like  bhang .â "

"â So I think now, and moreover, it did me no sort of good. But that was"
"very long ago,â  he made as to brush it all away with a thin brown"
"handâ â and since then, and especially in the nights under the punkah at"
"the  madrissah , I have thought very greatly.â "

â Is it permitted to ask whither the Heaven-bornâ s thought might have
"led?â  said Mahbub, with an elaborate sarcasm, smoothing his scarlet"
beard.

"â It is permitted,â  said Kim, and threw back the very tone. â They say at"
Nucklao that no Sahib must tell a black man that he has made a fault.â 

"Mahbubâ s hand shot into his bosom, for to call a Pathan a â black manâ "
( kala admi ) is a blood-insult. Then he remembered and laughed.
"â Speak, Sahib. Thy black man hears.â "

"â But,â  said Kim, â I am  not  a Sahib, and I say I made a fault to curse"
"thee, Mahbub Ali, on that day at Umballa when I thought I was betrayed"
"by a Pathan. I was senseless; for I was but newly caught, and I wished"
"to kill that low-caste drummer-boy. I say now, Hajji, that it was well"
done; and I see my road all clear before me to a good service. I will
stay in the  madrissah  till I am ripe.â 

â Well said. Especially are distances and numbers and the manner of
using compasses to be learned in that game. One waits in the Hills
above to show thee.â 

â I will learn their teaching upon a conditionâ that my time is given to
me without question when the  madrissah  is shut. Ask that for me of
the Colonel.â 

â But why not ask the Colonel in the Sahibsâ  tongue?â 

â The Colonel is the servant of the Government. He is sent hither and
"yon at a word, and must consider his own advancement. (See how much I"
"have already learned at Nucklao!) Moreover, the Colonel I know since"
three months only. I have known one Mahbub Ali for six years. So! To
the  madrissah  I will go. At the  madrissah  I will learn. In the
" madrissah  I will be a Sahib. But when the  madrissah  is shut, then"
must I be free and go among my people. Otherwise I die!â 

"â And who are thy people, Friend of all the World?â "

"â This great and beautiful land,â  said Kim, waving his paw round the"
little clay-walled room where the oil-lamp in its niche burned heavily
"through the tobacco-smoke. â And, further, I would see my lama again."
"And, further, I need money.â "

"â That is the need of everyone,â  said Mahbub ruefully. â I will give thee"
"eight annas, for much money is not picked out of horsesâ  hooves, and it"
"must suffice for many days. As to all the rest, I am well pleased, and"
"no further talk is needed. Make haste to learn, and in three years, or"
"it may be less, thou wilt be an aidâ even to me.â "

"â Have I been such a hindrance till now?â  said Kim, with a boyâ s giggle."

"â Do not give answers,â  Mahbub grunted. â Thou art my new horse-boy. Go"
"and bed among my men. They are near the north end of the station, with"
the horses.â 

â They will beat me to the south end of the station if I come without
authority.â 

"Mahbub felt in his belt, wetted his thumb on a cake of Chinese ink, and"
dabbed the impression on a piece of soft native paper. From Balkh to
Bombay men know that rough-ridged print with the old scar running
diagonally across it.

â That is enough to show my headman. I come in the morning.â 

â By which road?â  said Kim.

"â By the road from the city. There is but one, and then we return to"
Creighton Sahib. I have saved thee a beating.â 

â Allah! What is a beating when the very head is loose on the
shoulders?â 

"Kim slid out quietly into the night, walked half round the house,"
"keeping close to the walls, and headed away from the station for a mile"
"or so. Then, fetching a wide compass, he worked back at leisure, for he"
needed time to invent a story if any of Mahbubâ s retainers asked
questions.

"They were camped on a piece of waste ground beside the railway, and,"
"being natives, had not, of course, unloaded the two trucks in which"
Mahbubâ s animals stood among a consignment of country-breds bought by
"the Bombay tram-company. The headman, a broken-down,"
"consumptive-looking Mohammedan, promptly challenged Kim, but was"
pacified at sight of Mahbubâ s sign-manual.

"â The Hajji has of his favour given me service,â  said Kim testily. â If"
"this be doubted, wait till he comes in the morning. Meantime, a place"
by the fire.â 

Followed the usual aimless babble that every low-caste native must
"raise on every occasion. It died down, and Kim lay out behind the"
"little knot of Mahbubâ s followers, almost under the wheels of a"
"horse-truck, a borrowed blanket for covering. Now a bed among brickbats"
"and ballast-refuse on a damp night, between overcrowded horses and"
"unwashed Baltis, would not appeal to many white boys; but Kim was"
"utterly happy. Change of scene, service, and surroundings were the"
"breath of his little nostrils, and thinking of the neat white cots of"
St Xavierâ s all arow under the punkah gave him joy as keen as the
repetition of the multiplication-table in English.

"â I am very old,â  he thought sleepily. â Every month I become a year more"
"old. I was very young, and a fool to boot, when I took Mahbubâ s message"
to Umballa. Even when I was with that white Regiment I was very young
"and small and had no wisdom. But now I learn every day, and in three"
years the Colonel will take me out of the  madrissah  and let me go
"upon the Road with Mahbub hunting for horsesâ  pedigrees, or maybe I"
shall go by myself; or maybe I shall find the lama and go with him.
Yes; that is best. To walk again as a  chela  with my lama when he
comes back to Benares.â 

The thoughts came more slowly and disconnectedly. He was plunging into
"a beautiful dreamland when his ears caught a whisper, thin and sharp,"
above the monotonous babble round the fire. It came from behind the
iron-skinned horse-truck.

"â He is not here, then?â "

â Where should he be but roystering in the city. Who looks for a rat in
a frog-pond? Come away. He is not our man.â 

â He must not go back beyond the Passes a second time. It is the order.â 

"â Hire some woman to drug him. It is a few rupees only, and there is no"
evidence.â 

â Except the woman. It must be more certain; and remember the price upon
his head.â 

"â Ay, but the police have a long arm, and we are far from the Border. If"
"it were in Peshawur, now!â "

"â Yesâ in Peshawur,â  the second voice sneered. â Peshawur, full of his"
blood-kinâ full of bolt-holes and women behind whose clothes he will
"hide. Yes, Peshawur or Jehannum would suit us equally well.â "

â Then what is the plan?â 

"â O fool, have I not told it a hundred times? Wait till he comes to lie"
"down, and then one sure shot. The trucks are between us and pursuit. We"
have but to run back over the lines and go our way. They will not see
whence the shot came. Wait here at least till the dawn. What manner of
" faquir  art thou, to shiver at a little watching?â "

"â Oho!â  thought Kim, behind close-shut eyes. â Once again it is Mahbub."
Indeed a white stallionâ s pedigree is not a good thing to peddle to
"Sahibs! Or maybe Mahbub has been selling other news. Now what is to do,"
"Kim? I know not where Mahbub houses, and if he comes here before the"
"dawn they will shoot him. That would be no profit for thee, Kim. And"
this is not a matter for the police. That would be no profit for
Mahbub; andâ â he giggled almost aloudâ â I do not remember any lesson at
Nucklao which will help me. Allah! Here is Kim and yonder are they.
"First, then, Kim must wake and go away, so that they shall not suspect."
A bad dream wakes a manâ thusâ â 

"He threw the blanket off his face, and raised himself suddenly with the"
"terrible, bubbling, meaningless yell of the Asiatic roused by"
nightmare.

â Urr-urr-urr-urr! Ya-la-la-la-la!  Narain!  The  churel!  The
 churel! â 

A  churel  is the peculiarly malignant ghost of a woman who has died in
"child-bed. She haunts lonely roads, her feet are turned backwards on"
"the ankles, and she leads men to torment."

"Louder rose Kimâ s quavering howl, till at last he leaped to his feet"
"and staggered off sleepily, while the camp cursed him for waking them."
"Some twenty yards farther up the line he lay down again, taking care"
that the whisperers should hear his grunts and groans as he recomposed
himself. After a few minutes he rolled towards the road and stole away
into the thick darkness.

"He paddled along swiftly till he came to a culvert, and dropped behind"
"it, his chin on a level with the coping-stone. Here he could command"
"all the night-traffic, himself unseen."

"Two or three carts passed, jingling out to the suburbs; a coughing"
policeman and a hurrying foot-passenger or two who sang to keep off
evil spirits. Then rapped the shod feet of a horse.

"â Ah! This is more like Mahbub,â  thought Kim, as the beast shied at the"
little head above the culvert.

"â OhÃ©â , Mahbub Ali,â  he whispered, â have a care!â "

"The horse was reined back almost on its haunches, and forced towards"
the culvert.

"â Never again,â  said Mahbub, â will I take a shod horse for night-work."
They pick up all the bones and nails in the city.â  He stooped to lift
"its forefoot, and that brought his head within a foot of Kimâ s."

"â Downâ keep down,â  he muttered. â The night is full of eyes.â "

â Two men wait thy coming behind the horse-trucks. They will shoot thee
"at thy lying down, because there is a price on thy head. I heard,"
sleeping near the horses.â 

"â Didst thou see them? ... Hold still, Sire of Devils!â  This furiously"
to the horse.

â No.â 

â Was one dressed belike as a  faquir? â 

"â One said to the other, â€˜What manner of  faquir  art thou, to shiver at"
a little watching?â â 

â Good. Go back to the camp and lie down. I do not die tonight.â 

Mahbub wheeled his horse and vanished. Kim tore back down the ditch
"till he reached a point opposite his second resting-place, slipped"
"across the road like a weasel, and re-coiled himself in the blanket."

"â At least Mahbub knows,â  he thought contentedly. â And certainly he"
spoke as one expecting it. I do not think those two men will profit by
tonightâ s watch.â 

"An hour passed, and, with the best will in the world to keep awake all"
"night, he slept deeply. Now and again a night train roared along the"
metals within twenty feet of him; but he had all the Orientalâ s
"indifference to mere noise, and it did not even weave a dream through"
his slumber.

Mahbub was anything but asleep. It annoyed him vehemently that people
outside his tribe and unaffected by his casual amours should pursue him
for the life. His first and natural impulse was to cross the line lower
"down, work up again, and, catching his well-wishers from behind,"
"summarily slay them. Here, he reflected with sorrow, another branch of"
"the Government, totally unconnected with Colonel Creighton, might"
demand explanations which would be hard to supply; and he knew that
south of the Border a perfectly ridiculous fuss is made about a corpse
or so. He had not been troubled in this way since he sent Kim to
"Umballa with the message, and hoped that suspicion had been finally"
diverted.

Then a most brilliant notion struck him.

"â The English do eternally tell the truth,â  he said, â therefore we of"
"this country are eternally made foolish. By Allah, I will tell the"
truth to an Englishman! Of what use is the Government police if a poor
Kabuli be robbed of his horses in their very trucks. This is as bad as
"Peshawur! I should lay a complaint at the station. Better still, some"
"young Sahib on the Railway! They are zealous, and if they catch thieves"
it is remembered to their honour.â 

"He tied up his horse outside the station, and strode on to the"
platform.

"â Hullo, Mahbub Aliâ  said a young Assistant District Traffic"
"Superintendent who was waiting to go down the lineâ a tall, tow-haired,"
horsey youth in dingy white linen. â What are you doing here? Selling
weedsâ eh?â 

â No; I am not troubled for my horses. I come to look for Lutuf Ullah. I
have a truck-load up the line. Could anyone take them out without the
Railwayâ s knowledge?â 

"â Shouldnâ t think so, Mahbub. You can claim against us if they do.â "

â I have seen two men crouching under the wheels of one of the trucks
"nearly all night.  Faquirs  do not steal horses, so I gave them no more"
"thought. I would find Lutuf Ullah, my partner.â "

â The deuce you did? And you didnâ t bother your head about it? â Pon my
"word, itâ s just almost as well that I met you. What were they like,"
eh?â 

"â They were only  faquirs . They will no more than take a little grain,"
"perhaps, from one of the trucks. There are many up the line. The State"
"will never miss the dole. I came here seeking for my partner, Lutuf"
Ullah.â 

â Never mind your partner. Where are your horse-trucks?â 

â A little to this side of the farthest place where they make lamps for
the trains.â â 

â The signal-box! Yes.â 

â And upon the rail nearest to the road upon the right-hand sideâ looking
up the line thus. But as regards Lutuf Ullahâ a tall man with a broken
"nose, and a Persian greyhound Aie!â "

The boy had hurried off to wake up a young and enthusiastic policeman;
"for, as he said, the Railway had suffered much from depredations in the"
goods-yard. Mahbub Ali chuckled in his dyed beard.

"â They will walk in their boots, making a noise, and then they will"
wonder why there are no  faquirs . They are very clever boysâ Barton
Sahib and Young Sahib.â 

"He waited idly for a few minutes, expecting to see them hurry up the"
"line girt for action. A light engine slid through the station, and he"
caught a glimpse of young Barton in the cab.

"â I did that child an injustice. He is not altogether a fool,â  said"
Mahbub Ali. â To take a fire-carriage for a thief is a new game!â 

"When Mahbub Ali came to his camp in the dawn, no one thought it worth"
"while to tell him any news of the night. No one, at least, but one"
"small horseboy, newly advanced to the great manâ s service, whom Mahbub"
called to his tiny tent to assist in some packing.

"â It is all known to me,â  whispered Kim, bending above saddlebags. â Two"
Sahibs came up on a  te-train . I was running to and fro in the dark on
this side of the trucks as the  te-train  moved up and down slowly.
"They fell upon two men sitting under this truckâ Hajji, what shall I do"
with this lump of tobacco? Wrap it in paper and put it under the
salt-bag? Yesâ and struck them down. But one man struck at a Sahib with
"a  faquirâ s  buckâ s hornâ  (Kim meant the conjoined black-buck horns,"
which are a  faquirâ s  sole temporal weapon)â â the blood came. So the
"other Sahib, first smiting his own man senseless, smote the stabber"
with a short gun which had rolled from the first manâ s hand. They all
raged as though mad together.â 

Mahbub smiled with heavenly resignation. â No! That is not so much
" dewanee  (madness, or a case for the civil courtâ the word can be"
"punned upon both ways) as  nizamut  (a criminal case). A gun, sayest"
thou? Ten good years in jail.â 

"â Then they both lay still, but I think they were nearly dead when they"
were put on the  te-train . Their heads moved thus. And there is much
blood on the line. Come and see?â 

â I have seen blood before. Jail is the sure placeâ and assuredly they
"will give false names, and assuredly no man will find them for a long"
time. They were unfriends of mine. Thy fate and mine seem on one
string. What a tale for the healer of pearls! Now swiftly with the
saddle-bags and the cooking-platter. We will take out the horses and
away to Simla.â 

"Swiftlyâ as Orientals understand speedâ with long explanations, with"
"abuse and windy talk, carelessly, amid a hundred checks for little"
"things forgotten, the untidy camp broke up and led the half-dozen stiff"
and fretful horses along the Kalka road in the fresh of the rain-swept
"dawn. Kim, regarded as Mahbub Aliâ s favourite by all who wished to"
"stand well with the Pathan, was not called upon to work. They strolled"
"on by the easiest of stages, halting every few hours at a wayside"
"shelter. Very many Sahibs travel along the Kalka road; and, as Mahbub"
"Ali says, every young Sahib must needs esteem himself a judge of a"
"horse, and, though he be over head in debt to the money-lender, must"
"make as if to buy. That was the reason that Sahib after Sahib, rolling"
"along in a stage-carriage, would stop and open talk. Some would even"
descend from their vehicles and feel the horsesâ  legs; asking inane
"questions, or, through sheer ignorance of the vernacular, grossly"
insulting the imperturbable trader.

"â When first I dealt with Sahibs, and that was when Colonel Soady Sahib"
was Governor of Fort Abazai and flooded the Commissionerâ s
"camping-ground for spite,â  Mahbub confided to Kim as the boy filled his"
"pipe under a tree, â I did not know how greatly they were fools, and"
"this made me wroth. As thusâ ,â  and he told Kim a tale of an expression,"
"misused in all innocence, that doubled Kim up with mirth. â Now I see,"
"however,â â he exhaled smoke slowlyâ â that it is with them as with all"
"menâ in certain matters they are wise, and in others most foolish. Very"
foolish it is to use the wrong word to a stranger; for though the heart
"may be clean of offence, how is the stranger to know that? He is more"
like to search truth with a dagger.â 

"â True. True talk,â  said Kim solemnly. â Fools speak of a cat when a"
"woman is brought to bed, for instance. I have heard them.â "

"â Therefore, in one situate as thou art, it particularly behoves thee to"
"remember this with both kinds of faces. Among Sahibs, never forgetting"
"thou art a Sahib; among the folk of Hind, always remembering thou artâ â "
"He paused, with a puzzled smile."

"â What am I? Mussalman, Hindu, Jain, or Buddhist? That is a hard knot.â "

"â Thou art beyond question an unbeliever, and therefore thou wilt be"
damned. So says my Lawâ or I think it does. But thou art also my Little
"Friend of all the World, and I love thee. So says my heart. This matter"
of creeds is like horseflesh. The wise man knows horses are goodâ that
there is a profit to be made from all; and for myselfâ but that I am a
good Sunni and hate the men of Tirahâ I could believe the same of all
the Faiths. Now manifestly a Kathiawar mare taken from the sands of her
birthplace and removed to the west of Bengal foundersâ nor is even a
"Balkh stallion (and there are no better horses than those of Balkh,"
were they not so heavy in the shoulder) of any account in the great
Northern deserts beside the snow-camels I have seen. Therefore I say in
my heart the Faiths are like the horses. Each has merit in its own
country.â 

â But my lama said altogether a different thing.â 

"â Oh, he is an old dreamer of dreams from Bhotiyal. My heart is a little"
"angry, Friend of all the World, that thou shouldst see such worth in a"
man so little known.â 

"â It is true, Hajji; but that worth do I see, and to him my heart is"
drawn.â 

"â And his to thine, I hear. Hearts are like horses. They come and they"
go against bit or spur. Shout Gul Sher Khan yonder to drive in that bay
stallionâ s pickets more firmly. We do not want a horse-fight at every
"resting-stage, and the dun and the black will be locked in a little ..."
Now hear me. Is it necessary to the comfort of thy heart to see that
lama?â 

"â It is one part of my bond,â  said Kim. â If I do not see him, and if he"
"is taken from me, I will go out of that  madrissah  in Nucklao and,"
"andâ once gone, who is to find me again?â "

â It is true. Never was colt held on a lighter heel-rope than thou.â 
Mahbub nodded his head.

â Do not be afraid.â  Kim spoke as though he could have vanished on the
moment. â My lama has said that he will come to see me at the
 madrissah â â 

â A beggar and his bowl in the presence of those young Saâ â 

â Not all!â  Kim cut in with a snort. â Their eyes are blued and their
"nails are blackened with low-caste blood, many of them. Sons of"
 mehteeranees â brothers-in-law to the  bhungi  (sweeper).â 

We need not follow the rest of the pedigree; but Kim made his little
"point clearly and without heat, chewing a piece of sugar-cane the"
while.

"â Friend of all the World,â  said Mahbub, pushing over the pipe for the"
"boy to clean, â I have met many men, women, and boys, and not a few"
Sahibs. I have never in all my days met such an imp as thou art.â 

â And why? When I always tell thee the truth.â 

"â Perhaps the very reason, for this is a world of danger to honest men.â "
"Mahbub Ali hauled himself off the ground, girt in his belt, and went"
over to the horses.

â Or sell it?â 

There was that in the tone that made Mahbub halt and turn. â What new
devilry?â 

"â Eight annas, and I will tell,â  said Kim, grinning. â It touches thy"
peace.â 

â O Shaitan!â  Mahbub gave the money.

"â Rememberest thou the little business of the thieves in the dark, down"
yonder at Umballa?â 

"â Seeing they sought my life, I have not altogether forgotten. Why?â "

â Rememberest thou the Kashmir Serai?â 

â I will twist thy ears in a momentâ Sahib.â 

"â No needâ Pathan. Only, the second  faquir , whom the Sahibs beat"
"senseless, was the man who came to search thy bulkhead at Lahore. I saw"
his face as they helped him on the engine. The very same man.â 

â Why didst thou not tell before?â 

"â Oh, he will go to jail, and be safe for some years. There is no need"
"to tell more than is necessary at any one time. Besides, I did not then"
need money for sweetmeats.â 

â Allah kerim!â  said Mahbub Ah. â Wilt thou some day sell my head for a
few sweetmeats if the fit takes thee?â 

"Kim will remember till he dies that long, lazy journey from Umballa,"
"through Kalka and the Pinjore Gardens near by, up to Simla. A sudden"
"spate in the Gugger River swept down one horse (the most valuable, be"
"sure), and nearly drowned Kim among the dancing boulders. Farther up"
"the road the horses were stampeded by a Government elephant, and being"
"in high condition of grass food, it cost a day and a half to get them"
together again. Then they met Sikandar Khan coming down with a few
"unsaleable screwsâ remnants of his stringâ and Mahbub, who has more of"
horse-coping in his little fingernail than Sikandar Khan in all his
"tents, must needs buy two of the worst, and that meant eight hoursâ "
laborious diplomacy and untold tobacco. But it was all pure delightâ the
"wandering road, climbing, dipping, and sweeping about the growing"
spurs; the flush of the morning laid along the distant snows; the
"branched cacti, tier upon tier on the stony hillsides; the voices of a"
thousand water-channels; the chatter of the monkeys; the solemn
"deodars, climbing one after another with down-drooped branches; the"
vista of the Plains rolled out far beneath them; the incessant twanging
of the tonga-horns and the wild rush of the led horses when a tonga
swung round a curve; the halts for prayers (Mahbub was very religious
in dry-washings and bellowings when time did not press); the evening
"conferences by the halting-places, when camels and bullocks chewed"
solemnly together and the stolid drivers told the news of the Roadâ all
these things lifted Kimâ s heart to song within him.

"â But, when the singing and dancing is done,â  said Mahbub Ali, â comes"
"the Colonel Sahibâ s, and that is not so sweet.â "

â A fair landâ a most beautiful land is this of Hindâ and the land of the
"Five Rivers is fairer than all,â  Kim half chanted. â Into it I will go"
again if Mahbub Ali or the Colonel lift hand or foot against me. Once
"gone, who shall find me? Look, Hajji, is yonder the city of Simla?"
"Allah, what a city!â "

"â My fatherâ s brother, and he was an old man when Mackerson Sahibâ s well"
"was new at Peshawur, could recall when there were but two houses in"
it.â 

He led the horses below the main road into the lower Simla bazarâ the
crowded rabbit-warren that climbs up from the valley to the Town Hall
at an angle of forty-five. A man who knows his way there can defy all
"the police of Indiaâ s summer capital, so cunningly does veranda"
"communicate with veranda, alley-way with alley-way, and bolt-hole with"
bolt-hole. Here live those who minister to the wants of the glad
cityâ jhampanis who pull the pretty ladiesâ  â rickshaws by night and
"gamble till the dawn; grocers, oil-sellers, curio-vendors,"
"firewood-dealers, priests, pickpockets, and native employees of the"
Government. Here are discussed by courtesans the things which are
supposed to be profoundest secrets of the India Council; and here
"gather all the sub-sub-agents of half the Native States. Here, too,"
"Mahbub Ali rented a room, much more securely locked than his bulkhead"
"at Lahore, in the house of a Mohammedan cattle-dealer. It was a place"
"of miracles, too, for there went in at twilight a Mohammedan horseboy,"
and there came out an hour later a Eurasian ladâ the Lucknow girlâ s dye
was of the bestâ in badly-fitting shop-clothes.

"â I have spoken with Creighton Sahib,â  quoth Mahbub Ali, â and a second"
time has the Hand of Friendship averted the Whip of Calamity. He says
"that thou hast altogether wasted sixty days upon the Road, and it is"
"too late, therefore, to send thee to any Hill-school.â "

â I have said that my holidays are my own. I do not go to school twice
over. That is one part of my bond.â 

â The Colonel Sahib is not yet aware of that contract. Thou art to lodge
in Lurgan Sahibâ s house till it is time to go again to Nucklao.â 

"â I had sooner lodge with thee, Mahbub.â "

â Thou dost not know the honour. Lurgan Sahib himself asked for thee.
"Thou wilt go up the hill and along the road atop, and there thou must"
"forget for a while that thou hast ever seen or spoken to me, Mahbub"
"Ali, who sells horses to Creighton Sahib, whom thou dost not know."
Remember this order.â 

"Kim nodded. â Good,â  said he, â and who is Lurgan Sahib? Nayâ â he caught"
Mahbubâ s sword-keen glanceâ â indeed I have never heard his name. Is he
by chanceâ he lowered his voiceâ â one of us?â 

"â What talk is this of  us , Sahib?â  Mahbub Ali returned, in the tone he"
used towards Europeans. â I am a Pathan; thou art a Sahib and the son of
a Sahib. Lurgan Sahib has a shop among the European shops. All Simla
"knows it. Ask there ... and, Friend of all the World, he is one to be"
"obeyed to the last wink of his eyelashes. Men say he does magic, but"
that should not touch thee. Go up the hill and ask. Here begins the
Great Game.â 




CHAPTER IX


Sâ  doaks was son of Yelth the wiseâ 
Chief of the Raven clan.
Itswoot the Bear had him in care
To make him a medicine-man.

He was quick and quicker to learnâ 
Bold and bolder to dare:
He danced the dread Kloo-Kwallie Dance
To tickle Itswoot the Bear!

 Oregon Legend. 

Kim flung himself whole-heartedly upon the next turn of the wheel. He
"would be a Sahib again for a while. In that idea, so soon as he had"
"reached the broad road under Simla Town Hall, he cast about for one to"
"impress. A Hindu child, some ten years old, squatted under a lamp-post."

â Where is Mr Lurganâ s house?â  demanded Kim.

"â I do not understand English,â  was the answer, and Kim shifted his"
speech accordingly.

â I will show.â 

"Together they set off through the mysterious dusk, full of the noises"
"of a city below the hillside, and the breath of a cool wind in"
"deodar-crowned Jakko, shouldering the stars. The house-lights,"
"scattered on every level, made, as it were, a double firmament. Some"
"were fixed, others belonged to the â rickshaws of the careless,"
"open-spoken English folk, going out to dinner."

"â It is here,â  said Kimâ s guide, and halted in a veranda flush with the"
"main road. No door stayed them, but a curtain of beaded reeds that"
split up the lamplight beyond.

"â He is come,â  said the boy, in a voice little louder than a sigh, and"
vanished. Kim felt sure that the boy had been posted to guide him from
"the first, but, putting a bold face on it, parted the curtain. A"
"black-bearded man, with a green shade over his eyes, sat at a table,"
"and, one by one, with short, white hands, picked up globules of light"
"from a tray before him, threaded them on a glancing silken string, and"
hummed to himself the while. Kim was conscious that beyond the circle
of light the room was full of things that smelt like all the temples of
"all the East. A whiff of musk, a puff of sandal-wood, and a breath of"
sickly jessamine-oil caught his opened nostrils.

"â I am here,â  said Kim at last, speaking in the vernacular: the smells"
made him forget that he was to be a Sahib.

"â Seventy-nine, eighty, eighty-one,â  the man counted to himself,"
stringing pearl after pearl so quickly that Kim could scarcely follow
his fingers. He slid off the green shade and looked fixedly at Kim for
a full half-minute. The pupils of the eye dilated and closed to
"pin-pricks, as if at will. There was a  faquir  by the Taksali Gate who"
"had just this gift and made money by it, especially when cursing silly"
women. Kim stared with interest. His disreputable friend could further
"twitch his ears, almost like a goat, and Kim was disappointed that this"
new man could not imitate him.

"â Do not be afraid,â  said Lurgan Sahib suddenly."

â Why should I fear?â 

"â Thou wilt sleep here tonight, and stay with me till it is time to go"
again to Nucklao. It is an order.â 

"â It is an order,â  Kim repeated. â But where shall I sleep?â "

"â Here, in this room.â  Lurgan Sahib waved his hand towards the darkness"
behind him.

"â So be it,â  said Kim composedly. â Now?â "

"He nodded and held the lamp above his head. As the light swept them,"
there leaped out from the walls a collection of Tibetan devil-dance
"masks, hanging above the fiend-embroidered draperies of those ghastly"
"functionsâ horned masks, scowling masks, and masks of idiotic terror. In"
"a corner, a Japanese warrior, mailed and plumed, menaced him with a"
"halberd, and a score of lances and  khandas  and  kuttars  gave back"
the unsteady gleam. But what interested Kim more than all these
thingsâ he had seen devil-dance masks at the Lahore Museumâ was a glimpse
"of the soft-eyed Hindu child who had left him in the doorway, sitting"
cross-legged under the table of pearls with a little smile on his
scarlet lips.

â I think that Lurgan Sahib wishes to make me afraid. And I am sure that
that devilâ s brat below the table wishes to see me afraid.

"â This place,â  he said aloud, â is like a Wonder House. Where is my bed?â "

Lurgan Sahib pointed to a native quilt in a corner by the loathsome
"masks, picked up the lamp, and left the room black."

â Was that Lurgan Sahib?â  Kim asked as he cuddled down. No answer. He
"could hear the Hindu boy breathing, however, and, guided by the sound,"
"crawled across the floor, and cuffed into the darkness, crying: â Give"
"answer, devil! Is this the way to lie to a Sahib?â "

From the darkness he fancied he could hear the echo of a chuckle. It
"could not be his soft-fleshed companion, because he was weeping. So Kim"
lifted up his voice and called aloud:

â Lurgan Sahib! O Lurgan Sahib! Is it an order that thy servant does not
speak to me?â 

â It is an order.â  The voice came from behind him and he started.

"â Very good. But remember,â  he muttered, as he resought the quilt, â I"
will beat thee in the morning. I do not love Hindus.â 

That was no cheerful night; the room being overfull of voices and
music. Kim was waked twice by someone calling his name. The second time
"he set out in search, and ended by bruising his nose against a box that"
"certainly spoke with a human tongue, but in no sort of human accent. It"
seemed to end in a tin trumpet and to be joined by wires to a smaller
"box on the floorâ so far, at least, as he could judge by touch. And the"
"voice, very hard and whirring, came out of the trumpet. Kim rubbed his"
"nose and grew furious, thinking, as usual, in Hindi."

"â This with a beggar from the bazar might be good, butâ I am a Sahib and"
"the son of a Sahib and, which is twice as much more beside, a student"
"of Nucklao. Yessâ  (here he turned to English), â a boy of St Xavierâ s."
Damn Mr Lurganâ s eyes!â It is some sort of machinery like a
"sewing-machine. Oh, it is a  great  cheek of himâ we are not frightened"
that way at Lucknowâ No!â  Then in Hindi: â But what does  he  gain? He is
only a traderâ I am in his shop. But Creighton Sahib is a Colonelâ and I
think Creighton Sahib gave orders that it should be done.  How  I will
beat that Hindu in the morning! What is this?â 

The trumpet-box was pouring out a string of the most elaborate abuse
"that even Kim had ever heard, in a high uninterested voice, that for a"
moment lifted the short hairs of his neck. When the vile thing drew
"breath, Kim was reassured by the soft, sewing-machine-like whirr."

"â  ChÃ»p!  (Be still)â  he cried, and again he heard a chuckle that"
decided him. â  ChÃ»p â or I break your head.â 

The box took no heed. Kim wrenched at the tin trumpet and something
lifted with a click. He had evidently raised a lid. If there were a
"devil inside, now was its time, forâ he sniffedâ thus did the"
sewing-machines of the bazar smell. He would clean that  shaitan . He
"slipped off his jacket, and plunged it into the boxâ s mouth. Something"
"long and round bent under the pressure, there was a whirr and the voice"
stoppedâ as voices must if you ram a thrice-doubled coat on to the wax
cylinder and into the works of an expensive phonograph. Kim finished
his slumbers with a serene mind.

In the morning he was aware of Lurgan Sahib looking down on him.

"â Oah!â  said Kim, firmly resolved to cling to his Sahib-dom. â There was"
a box in the night that gave me bad talk. So I stopped it. Was it your
box?â 

The man held out his hand.

"â Shake hands, Oâ Hara,â  he said. â Yes, it was my box. I keep such things"
"because my friends the Rajahs like them. That one is broken, but it was"
"cheap at the price. Yes, my friends, the Kings, are very fond of"
toysâ and so am I sometimes.â 

Kim looked him over out of the corners of his eyes. He was a Sahib in
"that he wore Sahibâ s clothes; the accent of his Urdu, the intonation of"
"his English, showed that he was anything but a Sahib. He seemed to"
"understand what moved in Kimâ s mind ere the boy opened his mouth, and"
he took no pains to explain himself as did Father Victor or the Lucknow
masters. Sweetest of allâ he treated Kim as an equal on the Asiatic
side.

â I am sorry you cannot beat my boy this morning. He says he will kill
"you with a knife or poison. He is jealous, so I have put him in the"
corner and I shall not speak to him today. He has just tried to kill
me. You must help me with the breakfast. He is almost too jealous to
"trust, just now.â "

Now a genuine imported Sahib from England would have made a great to-do
over this tale. Lurgan Sahib stated it as simply as Mahbub Ali was used
to record his little affairs in the North.

"The back veranda of the shop was built out over the sheer hillside, and"
"they looked down into their neighboursâ  chimney-pots, as is the custom"
of Simla. But even more than the purely Persian meal cooked by Lurgan
"Sahib with his own hands, the shop fascinated Kim. The Lahore Museum"
"was larger, but here were more wondersâ ghost-daggers and prayer-wheels"
from Tibet; turquoise and raw amber necklaces; green jade bangles;
curiously packed incense-sticks in jars crusted over with raw garnets;
the devil-masks of overnight and a wall full of peacock-blue draperies;
"gilt figures of Buddha, and little portable lacquer altars; Russian"
samovars with turquoises on the lid; egg-shell china sets in quaint
octagonal cane boxes; yellow ivory crucifixesâ from Japan of all places
"in the world, so Lurgan Sahib said; carpets in dusty bales, smelling"
"atrociously, pushed back behind torn and rotten screens of geometrical"
work; Persian water-jugs for the hands after meals; dull copper
"incense-burners neither Chinese nor Persian, with friezes of fantastic"
devils running round them; tarnished silver belts that knotted like raw
"hide; hairpins of jade, ivory, and plasma; arms of all sorts and kinds,"
"and a thousand other oddments were cased, or piled, or merely thrown"
"into the room, leaving a clear space only round the rickety deal table,"
where Lurgan Sahib worked.

"â Those things are nothing,â  said his host, following Kimâ s glance. â I"
"buy them because they are pretty, and sometimes I sellâ if I like the"
buyerâ s look. My work is on the tableâ some of it.â 

"It blazed in the morning lightâ all red and blue and green flashes,"
picked out with the vicious blue-white spurt of a diamond here and
there. Kim opened his eyes.

"â Oh, they are quite well, those stones. It will not hurt them to take"
"the sun. Besides, they are cheap. But with sick stones it is very"
different.â  He piled Kimâ s plate anew. â There is no one but  me  can
doctor a sick pearl and re-blue turquoises. I grant you opalsâ any fool
can cure an opalâ but for a sick pearl there is only me. Suppose I were
to die! Then there would be no one ... Oh no!  You  cannot do anything
with jewels. It will be quite enough if you understand a little about
the Turquoiseâ some day.â 

"He moved to the end of the veranda to refill the heavy, porous clay"
water-jug from the filter.

â Do you want drink?â 

"Kim nodded. Lurgan Sahib, fifteen feet off, laid one hand on the jar."
"Next instant, it stood at Kimâ s elbow, full to within half an inch of"
"the brimâ the white cloth only showing, by a small wrinkle, where it had"
slid into place.

â Wah!â  said Kim in most utter amazement. â That is magic.â  Lurgan
Sahibâ s smile showed that the compliment had gone home.

â Throw it back.â 

â It will break.â 

"â I say, throw it back.â "

"Kim pitched it at random. It fell short and crashed into fifty pieces,"
while the water dripped through the rough veranda boarding.

â I said it would break.â 

â All one. Look at it. Look at the largest piece.â 

"That lay with a sparkle of water in its curve, as it were a star on the"
floor. Kim looked intently. Lurgan Sahib laid one hand gently on the
"nape of his neck, stroked it twice or thrice, and whispered: â Look! It"
"shall come to life again, piece by piece. First the big piece shall"
join itself to two others on the right and the leftâ on the right and
the left. Look!â 

"To save his life, Kim could not have turned his head. The light touch"
"held him as in a vice, and his blood tingled pleasantly through him."
"There was one large piece of the jar where there had been three, and"
above them the shadowy outline of the entire vessel. He could see the
"veranda through it, but it was thickening and darkening with each beat"
of his pulse. Yet the jarâ how slowly the thoughts came!â the jar had
been smashed before his eyes. Another wave of prickling fire raced down
"his neck, as Lurgan Sahib moved his hand."

"â Look! It is coming into shape,â  said Lurgan Sahib."

"So far Kim had been thinking in Hindi, but a tremor came on him, and"
"with an effort like that of a swimmer before sharks, who hurls himself"
"half out of the water, his mind leaped up from a darkness that was"
swallowing it and took refuge inâ the multiplication-table in English!

"â Look! It is coming into shape,â  whispered Lurgan Sahib."

"The jar had been smashedâ yess, smashedâ not the native word, he would"
"not think of thatâ but smashedâ into fifty pieces, and twice three was"
"six, and thrice three was nine, and four times three was twelve. He"
clung desperately to the repetition. The shadow-outline of the jar
cleared like a mist after rubbing eyes. There were the broken shards;
"there was the spilt water drying in the sun, and through the cracks of"
"the veranda showed, all ribbed, the white house-wall belowâ and thrice"
twelve was thirty-six!

â Look! Is it coming into shape?â  asked Lurgan Sahib.

"â But it is smashedâ smashed,â  he gaspedâ Lurgan Sahib had been muttering"
softly for the last half-minute. Kim wrenched his head aside. â Look!
 Dekho!  It is there as it was there.â 

"â It is there as it was there,â  said Lurgan, watching Kim closely while"
the boy rubbed his neck. â But you are the first of many who has ever
seen it so.â  He wiped his broad forehead.

â Was that more magic?â  Kim asked suspiciously. The tingle had gone from
his veins; he felt unusually wide awake.

"â No, that was not magic. It was only to see if there wasâ a flaw in a"
jewel. Sometimes very fine jewels will fly all to pieces if a man holds
"them in his hand, and knows the proper way. That is why one must be"
"careful before one sets them. Tell me, did you see the shape of the"
pot?â 

â For a little time. It began to grow like a flower from the ground.â 

"â And then what did you do? I mean, how did you think?â "

"â Oah! I knew it was broken, and so, I think, that was what I"
thoughtâ and it was broken.â 

â Hm! Has anyone ever done that same sort of magic to you before?â 

"â If it was,â  said Kim â do you think I should let it again? I should run"
away.â 

â And now you are not afraidâ eh?â 

â Not now.â 

Lurgan Sahib looked at him more closely than ever. â I shall ask Mahbub
"Aliâ not now, but some day later,â  he muttered. â I am pleased with"
youâ yes; and I am pleased with youâ no. You are the first that ever
saved himself. I wish I knew what it was that ... But you are right.
You should not tell thatâ not even to me.â 

"He turned into the dusky gloom of the shop, and sat down at the table,"
"rubbing his hands softly. A small, husky sob came from behind a pile of"
carpets. It was the Hindu child obediently facing towards the wall. His
thin shoulders worked with grief.

"â Ah! He is jealous, so jealous. I wonder if he will try to poison me"
"again in my breakfast, and make me cook it twice."

"â  Kubbee â  kubbee nahin, â  came the broken answer."

â And whether he will kill this other boy?â 

â  Kubbeeâ kubbee nahin. â  (Neverâ never. No!)

â What do  you  think he will do?â  He turned suddenly on Kim.

"â Oah! I do not know. Let him go, perhaps. Why did he want to poison"
you?â 

"â Because he is so fond of me. Suppose you were fond of someone, and you"
"saw someone come, and the man you were fond of was more pleased with"
"him than he was with you, what would you do?â "

Kim thought. Lurgan repeated the sentence slowly in the vernacular.

"â I should not poison that man,â  said Kim reflectively, â but I should"
"beat that boyâ  if  that boy was fond of my man. But first, I would ask"
that boy if it were true.â 

â Ah! He thinks everyone must be fond of me.â 

â Then I think he is a fool.â 

â Hearest thou?â  said Lurgan Sahib to the shaking shoulders. â The
"Sahibâ s son thinks thou art a little fool. Come out, and next time thy"
"heart is troubled, do not try white arsenic quite so openly. Surely the"
Devil Dasim was lord of our table-cloth that day! It might have made me
"ill, child, and then a stranger would have guarded the jewels. Come!â "

"The child, heavy-eyed with much weeping, crept out from behind the bale"
"and flung himself passionately at Lurgan Sahibâ s feet, with an"
extravagance of remorse that impressed even Kim.

"â I will look into the ink-poolsâ I will faithfully guard the jewels! Oh,"
"my Father and my Mother, send  him  away!â  He indicated Kim with a"
backward jerk of his bare heel.

â Not yetâ not yet. In a little while he will go away again. But now he
is at schoolâ at a new  madrissah â and thou shalt be his teacher. Play
the Play of the Jewels against him. I will keep tally.â 

"The child dried his tears at once, and dashed to the back of the shop,"
whence he returned with a copper tray.

"â Give me!â  he said to Lurgan Sahib. â Let them come from thy hand, for"
he may say that I knew them before.â 

"â Gentlyâ gently,â  the man replied, and from a drawer under the table"
dealt a half-handful of clattering trifles into the tray.

"â Now,â  said the child, waving an old newspaper. â Look on them as long"
"as thou wilt, stranger. Count and, if need be, handle. One look is"
enough for  me .â  He turned his back proudly.

â But what is the game?â 

â When thou hast counted and handled and art sure that thou canst
"remember them all, I cover them with this paper, and thou must tell"
over the tally to Lurgan Sahib.  I  will write mine.â 

â Oah!â  The instinct of competition waked in his breast. He bent over
"the tray. There were but fifteen stones on it. â That is easy,â  he said"
after a minute. The child slipped the paper over the winking jewels and
scribbled in a native account-book.

"â There are under that paper five blue stonesâ one big, one smaller, and"
"three small,â  said Kim, all in haste. â There are four green stones, and"
one with a hole in it; there is one yellow stone that I can see
"through, and one like a pipe-stem. There are two red stones, andâ andâ I"
"made the count fifteen, but two I have forgotten. No! Give me time. One"
"was of ivory, little and brownish; andâ andâ give me time...â "

â Oneâ twoâ â Lurgan Sahib counted him out up to ten. Kim shook his head.

"â Hear my count!â  the child burst in, trilling with laughter. â First,"
are two flawed sapphiresâ one of two ruttees and one of four as I should
judge. The four-ruttee sapphire is chipped at the edge. There is one
"Turkestan turquoise, plain with black veins, and there are two"
"inscribedâ one with a Name of God in gilt, and the other being cracked"
"across, for it came out of an old ring, I cannot read. We have now all"
"five blue stones. Four flawed emeralds there are, but one is drilled in"
"two places, and one is a little carvenâ â "

â Their weights?â  said Lurgan Sahib impassively.

â Threeâ fiveâ fiveâ and four ruttees as I judge it. There is one piece of
"old greenish pipe amber, and a cut topaz from Europe. There is one ruby"
"of Burma, of two ruttees, without a flaw, and there is a balas-ruby,"
"flawed, of two ruttees. There is a carved ivory from China representing"
a rat sucking an egg; and there is lastâ ah ha!â a ball of crystal as big
as a bean set on a gold leaf.â 

He clapped his hands at the close.

"â He is thy master,â  said Lurgan Sahib, smiling."

"â Huh! He knew the names of the stones,â  said Kim, flushing. â Try again!"
With common things such as he and I both know.â 

"They heaped the tray again with odds and ends gathered from the shop,"
"and even the kitchen, and every time the child won, till Kim marvelled."

"â Bind my eyesâ let me feel once with my fingers, and even  then  I will"
"leave thee opened-eyed behind,â  he challenged."

Kim stamped with vexation when the lad made his boast good.

"â If it were menâ or horses,â  he said, â I could do better. This playing"
with tweezers and knives and scissors is too little.â 

"â Learn firstâ teach later,â  said Lurgan Sahib. â Is he thy master?â "

â Truly. But how is it done?â 

â By doing it many times over till it is done perfectlyâ for it is worth
doing.â 

"The Hindu boy, in highest feather, actually patted Kim on the back."

"â Do not despair,â  he said. â I myself will teach thee.â "

"â And I will see that thou art well taught,â  said Lurgan Sahib, still"
"speaking in the vernacular, â for except my boy hereâ it was foolish of"
"him to buy so much white arsenic when, if he had asked, I could have"
given itâ except my boy here I have not in a long time met with one
better worth teaching. And there are ten days more ere thou canst
"return to Lucknao where they teach nothingâ at the long price. We shall,"
"I think, be friends.â "

"They were a most mad ten days, but Kim enjoyed himself too much to"
reflect on their craziness. In the morning they played the Jewel
"Gameâ sometimes with veritable stones, sometimes with piles of swords"
"and daggers, sometimes with photo-graphs of natives. Through the"
"afternoons he and the Hindu boy would mount guard in the shop, sitting"
dumb behind a carpet-bale or a screen and watching Mr Lurganâ s many and
"very curious visitors. There were small Rajahs, escorts coughing in the"
"veranda, who came to buy curiositiesâ such as phonographs and mechanical"
"toys. There were ladies in search of necklaces, and men, it seemed to"
Kimâ but his mind may have been vitiated by early trainingâ in search of
the ladies; natives from independent and feudatory Courts whose
ostensible business was the repair of broken necklacesâ rivers of light
poured out upon the tableâ but whose true end seemed to be to raise
money for angry Maharanees or young Rajahs. There were Babus to whom
"Lurgan Sahib talked with austerity and authority, but at the end of"
each interview he gave them money in coined silver and currency notes.
There were occasional gatherings of long-coated theatrical natives who
"discussed metaphysics in English and Bengali, to Mr Lurganâ s great"
edification. He was always interested in religions. At the end of the
"day, Kim and the Hindu boyâ whose name varied at Lurganâ s pleasureâ were"
expected to give a detailed account of all that they had seen and
"heardâ their view of each manâ s character, as shown in his face, talk,"
"and manner, and their notions of his real errand. After dinner, Lurgan"
"Sahibâ s fancy turned more to what might be called dressing-up, in which"
game he took a most informing interest. He could paint faces to a
marvel; with a brush-dab here and a line there changing them past
"recognition. The shop was full of all manner of dresses and turbans,"
"and Kim was apparelled variously as a young Mohammedan of good family,"
"an oilman, and onceâ which was a joyous eveningâ as the son of an Oudh"
landholder in the fullest of full dress. Lurgan Sahib had a hawkâ s eye
to detect the least flaw in the make-up; and lying on a worn teak-wood
"couch, would explain by the half-hour together how such and such a"
"caste talked, or walked, or coughed, or spat, or sneezed, and, since"
"â howsâ  matter little in this world, the â whyâ  of everything. The Hindu"
"child played this game clumsily. That little mind, keen as an icicle"
"where tally of jewels was concerned, could not temper itself to enter"
anotherâ s soul; but a demon in Kim woke up and sang with joy as he put
"on the changing dresses, and changed speech and gesture therewith."

"Carried away by enthusiasm, he volunteered to show Lurgan Sahib one"
"evening how the disciples of a certain caste of  faquir , old Lahore"
"acquaintances, begged doles by the roadside; and what sort of language"
"he would use to an Englishman, to a Punjabi farmer going to a fair, and"
"to a woman without a veil. Lurgan Sahib laughed immensely, and begged"
"Kim to stay as he was, immobile for half an hourâ cross-legged,"
"ash-smeared, and wild-eyed, in the back room. At the end of that time"
"entered a hulking, obese Babu whose stockinged legs shook with fat, and"
Kim opened on him with a shower of wayside chaff. Lurgan Sahibâ this
annoyed Kimâ watched the Babu and not the play.

"â I think,â  said the Babu heavily, lighting a cigarette, â I am of"
opeenion that it is most extraordinary and effeecient performance.
Except that you had told me I should have opined thatâ thatâ that you
were pulling my legs. How soon can he become approximately effeecient
chain-man? Because  then  I shall indent for him.â 

â That is what he must learn at Lucknow.â 

"â Then order him to be jolly-damâ -quick. Good-night, Lurgan.â  The Babu"
swung out with the gait of a bogged cow.

"When they were telling over the dayâ s list of visitors, Lurgan Sahib"
asked Kim who he thought the man might be.

â God knows!â  said Kim cheerily. The tone might almost have deceived
"Mahbub Ali, but it failed entirely with the healer of sick pearls."

"â That is true. God, He knows; but I wish to know what you think.â "

"Kim glanced sideways at his companion, whose eye had a way of"
compelling truth.

"â Iâ I think he will want me when I come from the school,"
"butâ â confidentially, as Lurgan Sahib nodded approvalâ â I do not"
understand how  he  can wear many dresses and talk many tongues.â 

â Thou wilt understand many things later. He is a writer of tales for a
"certain Colonel. His honour is great only in Simla, and it is"
"noticeable that he has no name, but only a number and a letterâ that is"
a custom among us.â 

â And is there a price upon his head tooâ as upon Mahâ all the others?â 

"â Not yet; but if a boy rose up who is now sitting here and wentâ look,"
"the door is open!â as far as a certain house with a red-painted veranda,"
"behind that which was the old theatre in the Lower Bazar, and whispered"
through the shutters: â€˜Hurree Chunder Mookerjee bore the bad news of
"last monthâ , that boy might take away a belt full of rupees.â "

â How many?â  said Kim promptly.

â Five hundredâ a thousandâ as many as he might ask for.â 

â Good. And for how long might such a boy live after the news was told?â 
He smiled merrily at Lurganâ s Sahibâ s very beard.

"â Ah! That is to be well thought of. Perhaps if he were very clever, he"
might live out the dayâ but not the night. By no means the night.â 

â Then what is the Babuâ s pay if so much is put upon his head?â 

â Eightyâ perhaps a hundredâ perhaps a hundred and fifty rupees; but the
"pay is the least part of the work. From time to time, God causes men to"
be bornâ and thou art one of themâ who have a lust to go abroad at the
risk of their lives and discover newsâ today it may be of far-off
"things, tomorrow of some hidden mountain, and the next day of some"
near-by men who have done a foolishness against the State. These souls
"are very few; and of these few, not more than ten are of the best."
"Among these ten I count the Babu, and that is curious. How great,"
"therefore, and desirable must be a business that brazens the heart of a"
Bengali!â 

"â True. But the days go slowly for me. I am yet a boy, and it is only"
within two months I learned to write Angrezi. Even now I cannot read it
well. And there are yet years and years and long years before I can be
even a chain-man.â 

"â Have patience, Friend of all the Worldâ â Kim started at the title."
â Would I had a few of the years that so irk thee. I have proved thee in
several small ways. This will not be forgotten when I make my report to
"the Colonel Sahib.â  Then, changing suddenly into English with a deep"
laugh:

"â By Jove! Oâ Hara, I think there is a great deal in you; but you must"
not become proud and you must not talk. You must go back to Lucknow and
"be a good little boy and mind your book, as the English say, and"
"perhaps, next holidays if you care, you can come back to me!â  Kimâ s"
"face fell. â Oh, I mean  if  you like. I know where you want to go.â "

Four days later a seat was booked for Kim and his small trunk at the
"rear of a Kalka tonga. His companion was the whale-like Babu, who, with"
"a fringed shawl wrapped round his head, and his fat openwork-stockinged"
"left leg tucked under him, shivered and grunted in the morning chill."

â How comes it that this man is one of  us? â  thought Kim considering
the jelly back as they jolted down the road; and the reflection threw
him into most pleasant day-dreams. Lurgan Sahib had given him five
rupeesâ a splendid sumâ as well as the assurance of his protection if he
"worked. Unlike Mahbub, Lurgan Sahib had spoken most explicitly of the"
"reward that would follow obedience, and Kim was content. If only, like"
"the Babu, he could enjoy the dignity of a letter and a numberâ and a"
price upon his head! Some day he would be all that and more. Some day
he might be almost as great as Mahbub Ali! The housetops of his search
"should be half India; he would follow Kings and Ministers, as in the"
old days he had followed  vakils  and lawyersâ  touts across Lahore city
"for Mahbub Aliâ s sake. Meantime, there was the present, and not at all"
"unpleasant, fact of St Xavierâ s immediately before him. There would be"
"new boys to condescend to, and there would be tales of holiday"
"adventures to hear. Young Martin, son of the tea-planter at Manipur,"
"had boasted that he would go to war, with a rifle, against the"
head-hunters.

"That might be, but it was certain young Martin had not been blown half"
across the forecourt of a Patiala palace by an explosion of fireworks;
nor had he... Kim fell to telling himself the story of his own
adventures through the last three months. He could paralyse St
"Xavierâ sâ even the biggest boys who shavedâ with the recital, were that"
"permitted. But it was, of course, out of the question. There would be a"
"price upon his head in good time, as Lurgan Sahib had assured him; and"
"if he talked foolishly now, not only would that price never be set, but"
Colonel Creighton would cast him offâ and he would be left to the wrath
of Lurgan Sahib and Mahbub Aliâ for the short space of life that would
remain to him.

"â So I should lose Delhi for the sake of a fish,â  was his proverbial"
philosophy. It behoved him to forget his holidays (there would always
"remain the fun of inventing imaginary adventures) and, as Lurgan Sahib"
"had said, to work. Of all the boys hurrying back to St Xavierâ s, from"
"Sukkur in the sands to Galle beneath the palms, none was so filled with"
"virtue as Kimball Oâ Hara, jiggeting down to Umballa behind Hurree"
"Chunder Mookerjee, whose name on the books of one section of the"
Ethnological Survey was R.17.

"And if additional spur were needed, the Babu supplied it. After a huge"
"meal at Kalka, he spoke uninterruptedly. Was Kim going to school? Then"
"he, an M A of Calcutta University, would explain the advantages of"
education. There were marks to be gained by due attention to Latin and
"Wordsworthâ s  Excursion  (all this was Greek to Kim). French, too was"
"vital, and the best was to be picked up in Chandernagore a few miles"
"from Calcutta. Also a man might go far, as he himself had done, by"
"strict attention to plays called  Lear  and  Julius CÃ¦sar , both much"
in demand by examiners.  Lear  was not so full of historical allusions
"as  Julius CÃ¦sar;  the book cost four annas, but could be bought"
"second-hand in Bow Bazar for two. Still more important than Wordsworth,"
"or the eminent authors, Burke and Hare, was the art and science of"
mensuration. A boy who had passed his examination in these branchesâ for
"which, by the way, there were no cram-booksâ could, by merely marching"
"over a country with a compass and a level and a straight eye, carry"
away a picture of that country which might be sold for large sums in
coined silver. But as it was occasionally inexpedient to carry about
measuring-chains a boy would do well to know the precise length of his
"own foot-pace, so that when he was deprived of what Hurree Chunder"
called adventitious aids he might still tread his distances. To keep
"count of thousands of paces, Hurree Chunderâ s experience had shown him"
nothing more valuable than a rosary of eighty-one or a hundred and
"eight beads, for â it was divisible and sub-divisible into many"
"multiples and sub-multiplesâ . Through the volleying drifts of English,"
"Kim caught the general trend of the talk, and it interested him very"
much. Here was a new craft that a man could tuck away in his head and
"by the look of the large wide world unfolding itself before him, it"
seemed that the more a man knew the better for him.

Said the Babu when he had talked for an hour and a half â I hope some
"day to enjoy your offeecial acquaintance.  Ad interim , if I may be"
"pardoned that expression, I shall give you this betel-box, which is"
highly valuable article and cost me two rupees only four years ago.â  It
"was a cheap, heart-shaped brass thing with three compartments for"
"carrying the eternal betel-nut, lime and  pan -leaf; but it was filled"
with little tabloid-bottles.

â That is reward of merit for your performance in character of that holy
"man. You see, you are so young you think you will last for ever and not"
take care of your body. It is great nuisance to go sick in the middle
"of business. I am fond of drugs myself, and they are handy to cure poor"
people too. These are good Departmental drugsâ quinine and so on. I give
it you for souvenir. Now good-bye. I have urgent private business here
by the roadside.â 

"He slipped out noiselessly as a cat, on the Umballa road, hailed a"
"passing cart and jingled away, while Kim, tongue-tied, twiddled the"
brass betel-box in his hands.

"The record of a boyâ s education interests few save his parents, and, as"
"you know, Kim was an orphan. It is written in the books of St Xavierâ s"
in Partibus that a report of Kimâ s progress was forwarded at the end of
"each term to Colonel Creighton and to Father Victor, from whose hands"
duly came the money for his schooling. It is further recorded in the
same books that he showed a great aptitude for mathematical studies as
"well as map-making, and carried away a prize ( The Life of Lord"
"Lawrence , tree-calf, two vols., nine rupees, eight annas) for"
proficiency therein; and the same term played in St Xavierâ s eleven
"against the Alighur Mohammedan College, his age being fourteen years"
and ten months. He was also re-vaccinated (from which we may assume
that there had been another epidemic of smallpox at Lucknow) about the
same time. Pencil notes on the edge of an old muster-roll record that
"he was punished several times for â conversing with improper personsâ ,"
and it seems that he was once sentenced to heavy pains for â absenting
himself for a day in the company of a street beggarâ . That was when he
got over the gate and pleaded with the lama through a whole day down
the banks of the Gumti to accompany him on the Road next holidaysâ for
one monthâ for a little week; and the lama set his face as a flint
"against it, averring that the time had not yet come. Kimâ s business,"
"said the old man as they ate cakes together, was to get all the wisdom"
of the Sahibs and then he would see. The Hand of Friendship must in
"some way have averted the Whip of Calamity, for six weeks later Kim"
seems to have passed an examination in elementary surveying â with great
"creditâ , his age being fifteen years and eight months. From this date"
the record is silent. His name does not appear in the yearâ s batch of
"those who entered for the subordinate Survey of India, but against it"
stand the words â removed on appointment.â 

"Several times in those three years, cast up at the Temple of the"
"Tirthankars in Benares the lama, a little thinner and a shade yellower,"
"if that were possible, but gentle and untainted as ever. Sometimes it"
"was from the South that he cameâ from south of Tuticorin, whence the"
wonderful fire-boats go to Ceylon where are priests who know Pali;
sometimes it was from the wet green West and the thousand
"cotton-factory chimneys that ring Bombay; and once from the North,"
where he had doubled back eight hundred miles to talk for a day with
the Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House. He would stride to his
"cell in the cool, cut marbleâ the priests of the Temple were good to the"
"old man,â wash off the dust of travel, make prayer, and depart for"
"Lucknow, well accustomed now to the way of the rail, in a third-class"
"carriage. Returning, it was noticeable, as his friend the Seeker"
"pointed out to the head-priest, that he ceased for a while to mourn the"
"loss of his River, or to draw wondrous pictures of the Wheel of Life,"
but preferred to talk of the beauty and wisdom of a certain mysterious
" chela  whom no man of the Temple had ever seen. Yes, he had followed"
the traces of the Blessed Feet throughout all India. (The Curator has
still in his possession a most marvellous account of his wanderings and
meditations.) There remained nothing more in life but to find the River
of the Arrow. Yet it was shown to him in dreams that it was a matter
not to be undertaken with any hope of success unless that seeker had
"with him the one  chela  appointed to bring the event to a happy issue,"
and versed in great wisdomâ such wisdom as white-haired Keepers of
"Images possess. For example (here came out the snuff-gourd, and the"
kindly Jain priests made haste to be silent):

"â Long and long ago, when Devadatta was King of Benaresâ let all listen"
to the  JÃ¢taka! â an elephant was captured for a time by the kingâ s
"hunters and ere he broke free, beringed with a grievous legiron. This"
"he strove to remove with hate and frenzy in his heart, and hurrying up"
"and down the forests, besought his brother-elephants to wrench it"
"asunder. One by one, with their strong trunks, they tried and failed."
At the last they gave it as their opinion that the ring was not to be
"broken by any bestial power. And in a thicket, new-born, wet with"
"moisture of birth, lay a day-old calf of the herd whose mother had"
"died. The fettered elephant, forgetting his own agony, said: â€˜If I do"
not help this suckling it will perish under our feet.â  So he stood
"above the young thing, making his legs buttresses against the uneasily"
"moving herd; and he begged milk of a virtuous cow, and the calf throve,"
and the ringed elephant was the calfâ s guide and defence. Now the days
of an elephantâ let all listen to the  JÃ¢taka! â are thirty-five years to
"his full strength, and through thirty-five Rains the ringed elephant"
"befriended the younger, and all the while the fetter ate into the"
flesh.

"â Then one day the young elephant saw the half-buried iron, and turning"
"to the elder said: â€˜What is this?â  â€˜It is even my sorrow,â  said he who"
had befriended him. Then that other put out his trunk and in the
"twinkling of an eyelash abolished the ring, saying: â€˜The appointed time"
has come.â  So the virtuous elephant who had waited temperately and done
"kind acts was relieved, at the appointed time, by the very calf whom he"
had turned aside to cherishâ let all listen to the  JÃ¢taka!  for the
"Elephant was Ananda, and the Calf that broke the ring was none other"
than The Lord Himself...â 

"Then he would shake his head benignly, and over the ever-clicking"
rosary point out how free that elephant-calf was from the sin of pride.
"He was as humble as a  chela  who, seeing his master sitting in the"
"dust outside the Gates of Learning, over-leapt the gates (though they"
were locked) and took his master to his heart in the presence of the
proud-stomached city. Rich would be the reward of such a master and
such a  chela  when the time came for them to seek freedom together!

"So did the lama speak, coming and going across India as softly as a"
bat. A sharp-tongued old woman in a house among the fruit-trees behind
"Saharunpore honoured him as the woman honoured the prophet, but his"
chamber was by no means upon the wall. In an apartment of the forecourt
"overlooked by cooing doves he would sit, while she laid aside her"
"useless veil and chattered of spirits and fiends of Kulu, of"
"grandchildren unborn, and of the free-tongued brat who had talked to"
"her in the resting-place. Once, too, he strayed alone from the Grand"
Trunk Road below Umballa to the very village whose priest had tried to
drug him; but the kind Heaven that guards lamas sent him at twilight
"through the crops, absorbed and unsuspicious, to the Rissaldarâ s door."
"Here was like to have been a grave misunderstanding, for the old"
soldier asked him why the Friend of the Stars had gone that way only
six days before.

"â That may not be,â  said the lama. â He has gone back to his own people.â "

"â He sat in that corner telling a hundred merry tales five nights ago,â "
"his host insisted. â True, he vanished somewhat suddenly in the dawn"
"after foolish talk with my granddaughter. He grows apace, but he is the"
same Friend of the Stars as brought me true word of the war. Have ye
parted?â 

"â Yesâ and no,â  the lama replied. â Weâ we have not altogether parted, but"
the time is not ripe that we should take the Road together. He acquires
wisdom in another place. We must wait.â 

â All oneâ but if it were not the boy how did he come to speak so
continually of thee?â 

â And what said he?â  asked the lama eagerly.

â Sweet wordsâ an hundred thousandâ that thou art his father and mother
and such all. Pity that he does not take the Qpeenâ s service. He is
fearless.â 

"This news amazed the lama, who did not then know how religiously Kim"
"kept to the contract made with Mahbub Ali, and perforce ratified by"
Colonel Creighton...

"â There is no holding the young pony from the game,â  said the"
horse-dealer when the Colonel pointed out that vagabonding over India
in holiday time was absurd. â If permission be refused to go and come as
"he chooses, he will make light of the refusal. Then who is to catch"
"him? Colonel Sahib, only once in a thousand years is a horse born so"
well fitted for the game as this our colt. And we need men.â 




CHAPTER X


"Your tiercelâ s too long at hack, Sire. Heâ s no eyass"
"But a passage-hawk that footed ere we caught him,"
Dangerously free oâ  the air. Faith! were he mine
(As mineâ s the glove he binds to for his tirings)
Iâ d fly him with a make-hawk. Heâ s in yarak
"Plumed to the very pointâ so manned, so weathered..."
"Give him the firmament God made him for,"
And what shall take the air of him?â  Old Play. 

"Lurgan Sahib did not use as direct speech, but his advice tallied with"
Mahbubâ s; and the upshot was good for Kim. He knew better now than to
"leave Lucknow city in native garb, and if Mahbub were anywhere within"
"reach of a letter, it was to Mahbubâ s camp he headed, and made his"
change under the Pathanâ s wary eye. Could the little Survey paint-box
that he used for map-tinting in term-time have found a tongue to tell
"of holiday doings, he might have been expelled. Once Mahbub and he went"
"together as far as the beautiful city of Bombay, with three truckloads"
"of tram-horses, and Mahbub nearly melted when Kim proposed a sail in a"
"dhow across the Indian Ocean to buy Gulf Arabs, which, he understood"
"from a hanger-on of the dealer Abdul Rahman, fetched better prices than"
mere Kabulis.

He dipped his hand into the dish with that great trader when Mahbub and
a few co-religionists were invited to a big Haj dinner. They came back
"by way of Karachi by sea, when Kim took his first experience of"
"sea-sickness sitting on the fore-hatch of a coasting-steamer, well"
persuaded he had been poisoned. The Babuâ s famous drug-box proved
"useless, though Kim had restocked it at Bombay. Mahbub had business at"
"Quetta, and there Kim, as Mahbub admitted, earned his keep, and perhaps"
"a little over, by spending four curious days as scullion in the house"
"of a fat Commissariat sergeant, from whose office-box, in an auspicious"
"moment, he removed a little vellum ledger which he copied outâ it seemed"
"to deal entirely with cattle and camel salesâ by moonlight, lying behind"
"an outhouse, all through one hot night. Then he returned the ledger to"
"its place, and, at Mahbubâ s word, left that service unpaid, rejoining"
"him six miles down the road, the clean copy in his bosom."

"â That soldier is a small fish,â  Mahbub Ali explained, â but in time we"
shall catch the larger one. He only sells oxen at two pricesâ one for
himself and one for the Governmentâ which I do not think is a sin.â 

â Why could not I take away the little book and be done with it?â 

"â Then he would have been frightened, and he would have told his master."
"Then we should miss, perhaps, a great number of new rifles which seek"
their way up from Quetta to the North. The Game is so large that one
sees but a little at a time.â 

"â Oho!â  said Kim, and held his tongue. That was in the monsoon holidays,"
after he had taken the prize for mathematics. The Christmas holidays he
"spentâ deducting ten days for private amusementsâ with Lurgan Sahib,"
where he sat for the most part in front of a roaring wood-fireâ Jakko
road was four feet deep in snow that yearâ andâ the small Hindu had gone
away to be marriedâ helped Lurgan to thread pearls. He made Kim learn
"whole chapters of the Koran by heart, till he could deliver them with"
"the very roll and cadence of a mullah. Moreover, he told Kim the names"
"and properties of many native drugs, as well as the runes proper to"
recite when you administer them. And in the evenings he wrote charms on
"parchmentâ elaborate pentagrams crowned with the names of devilsâ Murra,"
and Awan the Companion of Kingsâ all fantastically written in the
"corners. More to the point, he advised Kim as to the care of his own"
"body, the cure of fever-fits, and simple remedies of the Road. A week"
"before it was time to go down, Colonel Creighton Sahibâ this was"
unfairâ sent Kim a written examination paper that concerned itself
solely with rods and chains and links and angles.

"Next holidays he was out with Mahbub, and here, by the way, he nearly"
"died of thirst, plodding through the sand on a camel to the mysterious"
"city of Bikanir, where the wells are four hundred feet deep, and lined"
throughout with camel-bone. It was not an amusing trip from Kimâ s point
"of view, becauseâ in defiance of the contractâ the Colonel ordered him to"
"make a map of that wild, walled city; and since Mohammedan horse-boys"
and pipe-tenders are not expected to drag Survey-chains round the
"capital of an independent Native State, Kim was forced to pace all his"
distances by means of a bead rosary. He used the compass for bearings
"as occasion servedâ after dark chiefly, when the camels had been fedâ and"
by the help of his little Survey paint-box of six colour-cakes and
"three brushes, he achieved something not remotely unlike the city of"
"Jeysulmir. Mahbub laughed a great deal, and advised him to make up a"
written report as well; and in the back of the big account-book that
lay under the flap of Mahbubâ s pet saddle Kim fell to work..

â It must hold everything that thou hast seen or touched or considered.
Write as though the Jung-i-Lat Sahib himself had come by stealth with a
vast army outsetting to war.â 

â How great an army?â 

"â Oh, half a lakh of men.â "

â Folly! Remember how few and bad were the wells in the sand. Not a
thousand thirsty men could come near by here.â 

â Then write that downâ also all the old breaches in the walls and whence
the firewood is cutâ and what is the temper and disposition of the King.
I stay here till all my horses are sold. I will hire a room by the
"gateway, and thou shalt be my accountant. There is a good lock to the"
door.â 

"The report in its unmistakable St Xavierâ s running script, and the"
"brown, yellow, and lake-daubed map, was on hand a few years ago (a"
careless clerk filed it with the rough notes of Eâ s second Seistan
"survey), but by now the pencil characters must be almost illegible. Kim"
"translated it, sweating under the light of an oil-lamp, to Mahbub, the"
second day of their return-journey.

The Pathan rose and stooped over his dappled saddle-bags.

"â I knew it would be worthy a dress of honour, and so I made one ready,â "
"he said, smiling. â Were I Amir of Afghanistan (and some day we may see"
"him), I would fill thy mouth with gold.â  He laid the garments formally"
"at Kimâ s feet. There was a gold-embroidered Peshawur turban-cap, rising"
"to a cone, and a big turban-cloth ending in a broad fringe of gold."
There was a Delhi embroidered waistcoat to slip over a milky white
"shirt, fastening to the right, ample and flowing; green pyjamas with"
"twisted silk waist-string; and that nothing might be lacking,"
"russia-leather slippers, smelling divinely, with arrogantly curled"
tips.

"â Upon a Wednesday, and in the morning, to put on new clothes is"
"auspicious,â  said Mahbub solemnly. â But we must not forget the wicked"
folk in the world. So!â 

"He capped all the splendour, that was taking Kimâ s delighted breath"
"away, with a mother-of-pearl, nickel-plated, self-extracting .450"
revolver.

"â I had thought of a smaller bore, but reflected that this takes"
Government bullets. A man can always come by thoseâ especially across
the Border. Stand up and let me look.â  He clapped Kim on the shoulder.
"â May you never be tired, Pathan! Oh, the hearts to be broken! Oh, the"
"eyes under the eyelashes, looking sideways!â "

"Kim turned about, pointed his toes, stretched, and felt mechanically"
for the moustache that was just beginning. Then he stooped towards
"Mahbubâ s feet to make proper acknowledgment with fluttering,"
quick-patting hands; his heart too full for words. Mahbub forestalled
and embraced him.

"â My son, said he, â what need of words between us? But is not the little"
gun a delight? All six cartridges come out at one twist. It is borne in
"the bosom next the skin, which, as it were, keeps it oiled. Never put"
"it elsewhere, and please God, thou shalt some day kill a man with it.â "

â  Hai mai! â  said Kim ruefully. â If a Sahib kills a man he is hanged in
the jail.â 

"â True: but one pace beyond the Border, men are wiser. Put it away; but"
fill it first. Of what use is a gun unfed?â 

â When I go back to the  madrissah  I must return it. They do not allow
little guns. Thou wilt keep it for me?â 

"â Son, I am wearied of that  madrissah , where they take the best years"
of a man to teach him what he can only learn upon the Road. The folly
of the Sahibs has neither top nor bottom. No matter. Maybe thy written
report shall save thee further bondage; and God He knows we need men
more and more in the Game.â 

"They marched, jaw-bound against blowing sand, across the salt desert to"
"Jodhpur, where Mahbub and his handsome nephew Habib Ullah did much"
"trading; and then sorrowfully, in European clothes, which he was fast"
"outgrowing, Kim went second-class to St Xavierâ s. Three weeks later,"
"Colonel Creighton, pricing Tibetan ghost-daggers at Lurganâ s shop,"
faced Mahbub Ali openly mutinous. Lurgan Sahib operated as support in
reserve.

"â The pony is madeâ finishedâ mouthed and paced, Sahib! From now on, day"
"by day, he will lose his manners if he is kept at tricks. Drop the rein"
"on his back and let go,â  said the horse-dealer. â We need him.â "

"â But he is so young, Mahbubâ not more than sixteenâ is he?â "

"â When I was fifteen, I had shot my man and begot my man, Sahib.â "

â You impenitent old heathen!â  Creighton turned to Lurgan. The black
beard nodded assent to the wisdom of the Afghanâ s dyed scarlet.

"â  I  should have used him long ago,â  said Lurgan. â The younger the"
better. That is why I always have my really valuable jewels watched by
a child. You sent him to me to try. I tried him in every way: he is the
only boy I could not make to see things.â 

â In the crystalâ in the ink-pool?â  demanded Mahbub.

"â No. Under my hand, as I told you. That has never happened before. It"
"means that he is strong enoughâ but you think it skittles, Colonel"
Creightonâ to make anyone do anything he wants. And that is three years
"ago. I have taught him a good deal since, Colonel Creighton. I think"
you waste him now.â 

"â Hmm! Maybe youâ re right. But, as you know, there is no Survey work for"
him at present.â 

"â Let him out let him go,â  Mahbub interrupted. â Who expects any colt to"
carry heavy weight at first? Let him run with the caravansâ like our
"white camel-coltsâ for luck. I would take him myself, butâ â "

â There is a little business where he would be most usefulâ in the
"South,â  said Lurgan, with peculiar suavity, dropping his heavy blued"
eyelids.

"â E.23 has that in hand,â  said Creighton quickly. â He must not go down"
"there. Besides, he knows no Turki.â "

â Only tell him the shape and the smell of the letters we want and he
"will bring them back,â  Lurgan insisted."

"â No. That is a manâ s job,â  said Creighton."

It was a wry-necked matter of unauthorized and incendiary
correspondence between a person who claimed to be the ultimate
authority in all matters of the Mohammedan religion throughout the
"world, and a younger member of a royal house who had been brought to"
book for kidnapping women within British territory. The Moslem
Archbishop had been emphatic and over-arrogant; the young prince was
"merely sulky at the curtailment of his privileges, but there was no"
need he should continue a correspondence which might some day
"compromise him. One letter indeed had been procured, but the finder was"
"later found dead by the roadside in the habit of an Arab trader, as"
"E.23, taking up the work, duly reported."

"These facts, and a few others not to be published, made both Mahbub and"
Creighton shake their heads.

"â Let him go out with his Red Lama,â  said the horse-dealer with visible"
effort. â He is fond of the old man. He can learn his paces by the
rosary at least.â 

"â I have had some dealings with the old manâ by letter,â  said Colonel"
"Creighton, smiling to himself. â Whither goes he?â "

"â Up and down the land, as he has these three years. He seeks a River of"
Healing. Godâ s curse upon allâ â  Mahbub checked himself. â He beds down
at the Temple of the Tirthankars or at Buddh Gaya when he is in from
"the Road. Then he goes to see the boy at the  madrissah , as we know"
"for the boy was punished for it twice or thrice. He is quite mad, but a"
peaceful man. I have met him. The Babu also has had dealings with him.
We have watched him for three years. Red Lamas are not so common in
Hind that one loses track.â 

"â Babus are very curious,â  said Lurgan meditatively. â Do you know what"
Hurree Babu really wants? He wants to be made a member of the Royal
"Society by taking ethnological notes. I tell you, I tell him about the"
lama everything which Mahbub and the boy have told me. Hurree Babu goes
"down to Benaresâ at his own expense, I think.â "

"â  I  donâ t,â  said Creighton briefly. He had paid Hurreeâ s travelling"
"expenses, out of a most lively curiosity to learn what the lama might"
be.

"â And he applies to the lama for information on lamaism, and"
"devil-dances, and spells and charms, several times in these few years."
Holy Virgin! I could have told him all that yeears ago. I think Hurree
Babu is getting too old for the Road. He likes better to collect
"manners and customs information. Yes, he wants to be an FRS."

"â Hurree thinks well of the boy, doesnâ t he?â "

"â Oh, very indeedâ we have had some pleasant evenings at my little"
placeâ but I think it would be waste to throw him away with Hurree on
the Ethnological side.â 

"â Not for a first experience. How does that strike you, Mahbub? Let the"
boy run with the lama for six months. After that we can see. He will
get experience.â 

"â He has it already, Sahibâ as a fish controls the water he swims in. But"
for every reason it will be well to loose him from the school.â 

"â Very good, then,â  said Creighton, half to himself. â He can go with the"
"lama, and if Hurree Babu cares to keep an eye on them so much the"
better. He wonâ t lead the boy into any danger as Mahbub would.
"Curiousâ his wish to be an F R S. Very human, too. He  is  best on the"
Ethnological sideâ Hurree.â 

No money and no preferment would have drawn Creighton from his work on
"the Indian Survey, but deep in his heart also lay the ambition to write"
â F R Sâ  after his name. Honours of a sort he knew could be obtained by
"ingenuity and the help of friends, but, to the best of his belief,"
nothing save workâ papers representing a life of itâ took a man into the
Society which he had bombarded for years with monographs on strange
Asiatic cults and unknown customs. Nine men out of ten would flee from
a Royal Society soiree in extremity of boredom; but Creighton was the
"tenth, and at times his soul yearned for the crowded rooms in easy"
"London where silver-haired, bald-headed gentlemen who know nothing of"
"the Army move among spectroscopic experiments, the lesser plants of the"
"frozen tundras, electric flight-measuring machines, and apparatus for"
slicing into fractional millimetres the left eye of the female
"mosquito. By all right and reason, it was the Royal Geographical that"
"should have appealed to him, but men are as chancy as children in their"
"choice of playthings. So Creighton smiled, and thought the better of"
"Hurree Babu, moved by like desire."

He dropped the ghost-dagger and looked up at Mahbub.

"â How soon can we get the colt from the stable?â  said the horse-dealer,"
reading his eyes.

"â Hmm! If I withdraw him by order nowâ what will he do, think you? I have"
never before assisted at the teaching of such an one.â 

"â He will come to me,â  said Mahbub promptly. â Lurgan Sahib and I will"
prepare him for the Road.â 

"â So be it, then. For six months he shall run at his choice. But who"
will be his sponsor?â 

"Lurgan slightly inclined his head. â He will not tell anything, if that"
"is what you are afraid of, Colonel Creighton.â "

"â Itâ s only a boy, after all.â "

"â Ye-es; but first, he has nothing to tell; and secondly, he knows what"
"would happen. Also, he is very fond of Mahbub, and of me a little.â "

â Will he draw pay?â  demanded the practical horse-dealer.

â Food and water allowance only. Twenty rupees a month.â 

One advantage of the Secret Service is that it has no worrying audit.
"That Service is ludicrously starved, of course, but the funds are"
administered by a few men who do not call for vouchers or present
itemized accounts. Mahbubâ s eyes lighted with almost a Sikhâ s love of
money. Even Lurganâ s impassive face changed. He considered the years to
come when Kim would have been entered and made to the Great Game that
"never ceases day and night, throughout India. He foresaw honour and"
"credit in the mouths of a chosen few, coming to him from his pupil."
"Lurgan Sahib had made E.23 what E.23 was, out of a bewildered,"
"impertinent, lying, little North-West Province man."

But the joy of these masters was pale and smoky beside the joy of Kim
"when St Xavierâ s Head called him aside, with word that Colonel"
Creighton had sent for him.

"â I understand, Oâ Hara, that he has found you a place as an assistant"
chain-man in the Canal Department: that comes of taking up mathematics.
"It is great luck for you, for you are only sixteen; but of course you"
understand that you do not become  pukka  (permanent) till you have
passed the autumn examination. So you must not think you are going out
"into the world to enjoy yourself, or that your fortune is made. There"
"is a great deal of hard work before you. Only, if you succeed in"
"becoming  pukka , you can rise, you know, to four hundred and fifty a"
month.â  Whereat the Principal gave him much good advice as to his
"conduct, and his manners, and his morals; and others, his elders, who"
"had not been wafted into billets, talked as only Anglo-Indian lads can,"
"of favouritism and corruption. Indeed, young Cazalet, whose father was"
"a pensioner at Chunar, hinted very broadly that Colonel Creightonâ s"
"interest in Kim was directly paternal; and Kim, instead of retaliating,"
"did not even use language. He was thinking of the immense fun to come,"
"of Mahbubâ s letter of the day before, all neatly written in English,"
making appointment for that afternoon in a house the very name of which
would have crisped the Principalâ s hair with horror...

"Said Kim to Mahbub in Lucknow railway station that evening, above the"
"luggage-scales: â I feared lest at the last, the roof would fall upon me"
"and cheat me. It is indeed all finished, O my father?â "

"Mahbub snapped his fingers to show the utterness of that end, and his"
eyes blazed like red coals.

â Then where is the pistol that I may wear it?â 

"â Softly! A half-year, to run without heel-ropes. I begged that much"
from Colonel Creighton Sahib. At twenty rupees a month. Old Red Hat
knows that thou art coming.â 

"â I will pay thee  dustoorie  (commission) on my pay for three months,â "
"said Kim gravely. â Yea, two rupees a month. But first we must get rid"
of these.â  He plucked his thin linen trousers and dragged at his
collar. â I have brought with me all that I need on the Road. My trunk
has gone up to Lurgan Sahibâ s.â 

â Who sends his salaams to theeâ Sahib.â 

â Lurgan Sahib is a very clever man. But what dost thou do?â 

"â I go North again, upon the Great Game. What else? Is thy mind still"
set on following old Red Hat?â 

â Do not forget he made me that I amâ though he did not know it. Year by
"year, he sent the money that taught me.â "

"â I would have done as muchâ had it struck my thick head,â  Mahbub"
"growled. â Come away. The lamps are lit now, and none will mark thee in"
the bazar. We go to Huneefaâ s house.â 

"On the way thither, Mahbub gave him much the same sort of advice as his"
"mother gave to Lemuel, and curiously enough, Mahbub was exact to point"
out how Huneefa and her likes destroyed kings.

"â And I remember,â  he quoted maliciously, â one who said, â€˜Trust a snake"
"before an harlot, and an harlot before a Pathan, Mahbub Ali.â  Now,"
"excepting as to Pathans, of whom I am one, all that is true. Most true"
"is it in the Great Game, for it is by means of women that all plans"
come to ruin and we lie out in the dawning with our throats cut. So it
happened to such a one.â  He gave the reddest particulars.

â Then whyâ ?â  Kim paused before a filthy staircase that climbed to the
"warm darkness of an upper chamber, in the ward that is behind Azim"
Ullahâ s tobacco-shop. Those who know it call it The Birdcageâ it is so
full of whisperings and whistlings and chirrupings.

"The room, with its dirty cushions and half-smoked hookahs, smelt"
abominably of stale tobacco. In one corner lay a huge and shapeless
"woman clad in greenish gauzes, and decked, brow, nose, ear, neck,"
"wrist, arm, waist, and ankle with heavy native jewellery. When she"
turned it was like the clashing of copper pots. A lean cat in the
"balcony outside the window mewed hungrily. Kim checked, bewildered, at"
the door-curtain.

"â Is that the new stuff, Mahbub?â  said Huneefa lazily, scarce troubling"
to remove the mouthpiece from her lips. â O Buktanoos!â â like most of her
"kind, she swore by the Djinnsâ â O Buktanoos! He is very good to look"
upon.â 

"â That is part of the selling of the horse,â  Mahbub explained to Kim,"
who laughed.

"â I have heard that talk since my Sixth Day,â  he replied, squatting by"
the light. â Whither does it lead?â 

â To protection. Tonight we change thy colour. This sleeping under roofs
has blanched thee like an almond. But Huneefa has the secret of a
"colour that catches. No painting of a day or two. Also, we fortify thee"
"against the chances of the Road. That is  my  gift to thee, my son."
"Take out all metals on thee and lay them here. Make ready, Huneefa.â "

"Kim dragged forth his compass, Survey paint-box, and the new-filled"
"medicine-box. They had all accompanied his travels, and boylike he"
valued them immensely.

The woman rose slowly and moved with her hands a little spread before
"her. Then Kim saw that she was blind. â No, no,â  she muttered, â the"
"Pathan speaks truthâ my colour does not go in a week or a month, and"
those whom I protect are under strong guard.â 

"â When one is far off and alone, it would not be well to grow blotched"
"and leprous of a sudden,â  said Mahbub. â When thou wast with me I could"
"oversee the matter. Besides, a Pathan is a fair-skin. Strip to the"
waist now and look how thou art whitened.â  Huneefa felt her way back
"from an inner room. â It is no matter, she cannot see.â  He took a pewter"
bowl from her ringed hand.

The dye-stuff showed blue and gummy. Kim experimented on the back of
"his wrist, with a dab of cotton-wool; but Huneefa heard him."

"â No, no,â  she cried, â the thing is not done thus, but with the proper"
ceremonies. The colouring is the least part. I give thee the full
protection of the Road.â 

"â  Jadoo?  (magic),â said Kim, with a half start. He did not like the"
"white, sightless eyes. Mahbubâ s hand on his neck bowed him to the"
"floor, nose within an inch of the boards."

"â Be still. No harm comes to thee, my son. I am thy sacrifice!â "

"He could not see what the woman was about, but heard the dish-clash of"
her jewellery for many minutes. A match lit up the darkness; he caught
the well-known purr and fizzle of grains of incense. Then the room
"filled with smokeâ heavy aromatic, and stupefying. Through growing"
"drowse he heard the names of devilsâ of Zulbazan, Son of Eblis, who"
"lives in bazars and  paraos , making all the sudden lewd wickedness of"
"wayside halts; of Dulhan, invisible about mosques, the dweller among"
"the slippers of the faithful, who hinders folk from their prayers; and"
"Musboot, Lord of lies and panic. Huneefa, now whispering in his ear,"
"now talking as from an immense distance, touched him with horrible soft"
"fingers, but Mahbubâ s grip never shifted from his neck till, relaxing"
"with a sigh, the boy lost his senses."

â Allah! How he fought! We should never have done it but for the drugs.
"That was his white blood, I take it,â  said Mahbub testily. â Go on with"
the  dawut  (invocation). Give him full Protection.â 

"â  O Hearer! Thou that hearest with ears, be present. Listen, O"
"Hearer! â  Huneefa moaned, her dead eyes turned to the west. The dark"
room filled with moanings and snortings.

"From the outer balcony, a ponderous figure raised a round bullet head"
and coughed nervously.

"â Do not interrupt this ventriloquial necromanciss, my friend,â  it said"
"in English. â I opine that it is very disturbing to you, but no"
enlightened observer is jolly-well upset.â 

"â ... I will lay a plot for their ruin! O Prophet, bear with the"
"unbelievers. Let them alone awhile! â  Huneefaâ s face, turned to the"
"northward, worked horribly, and it was as though voices from the"
ceiling answered her.

"Hurree Babu returned to his note-book, balanced on the window-sill, but"
"his hand shook. Huneefa, in some sort of drugged ecstasy, wrenched"
"herself to and fro as she sat cross-legged by Kimâ s still head, and"
"called upon devil after devil, in the ancient order of the ritual,"
binding them to avoid the boyâ s every action.

â  With Him are the keys of the Secret Things! None knoweth them besides
Himself He knoweth that which is in the dry land and in the sea! â 
Again broke out the unearthly whistling responses.

â Iâ I apprehend it is not at all malignant in its operation?â  said the
"Babu, watching the throat-muscles quiver and jerk as Huneefa spoke with"
"tongues. â Itâ it is not likely that she has killed the boy? If so, I"
decline to be witness at the trial .....What was the last hypothetical
devil mentioned?â 

"â Babuji,â  said Mahbub in the vernacular. â I have no regard for the"
"devils of Hind, but the Sons of Eblis are far otherwise, and whether"
they be  jumalee  (well-affected) or  jullalee  (terrible) they love
not Kafirs.â 

"â Then you think I had better go?â  said Hurree Babu, half rising. â They"
"are, of course, dematerialized phenomena. Spencer says.â "

"Huneefaâ s crisis passed, as these things must, in a paroxysm of"
"howling, with a touch of froth at the lips. She lay spent and"
"motionless beside Kim, and the crazy voices ceased."

â Wah! That work is done. May the boy be better for it; and Huneefa is
"surely a mistress of  dawut . Help haul her aside, Babu. Do not be"
afraid.â 

"â How am I to fear the absolutely non-existent?â  said Hurree Babu,"
talking English to reassure himself. It is an awful thing still to
dread the magic that you contemptuously investigateâ to collect
folk-lore for the Royal Society with a lively belief in all Powers of
Darkness.

Mahbub chuckled. He had been out with Hurree on the Road ere now. â Let
"us finish the colouring,â  said he. â The boy is well protected ifâ if the"
"Lords of the Air have ears to hear. I am a  sufi  (free-thinker), but"
"when one can get blind-sides of a woman, a stallion, or a devil, why go"
"round to invite a kick? Set him upon the way, Babu, and see that old"
Red Hat does not lead him beyond our reach. I must get back to my
horses.â 

"â All raight,â  said Hurree Babu. â He is at present curious spectacle.â "

"About third cockcrow, Kim woke after a sleep of thousands of years."
"Huneefa, in her corner, snored heavily, but Mahbub was gone."

"â I hope you were not frightened,â  said an oily voice at his elbow. â I"
"superintended entire operation, which was most interesting from"
ethnological point of view. It was high-class  dawut .â 

"â Huh!â  said Kim, recognizing Hurree Babu, who smiled ingratiatingly."

â And also I had honour to bring down from Lurgan your present costume.
I am not in the habit offeecially of carrying such gauds to
"subordinates, butâ â he giggledâ â your case is noted as exceptional on the"
books. I hope Mr Lurgan will note my action.â 

Kim yawned and stretched himself. It was good to turn and twist within
loose clothes once again.

â What is this?â  He looked curiously at the heavy duffle-stuff loaded
with the scents of the far North.

â Oho! That is inconspicuous dress of  chela  attached to service of
"lamaistic lama.  Com plete in every particular,â  said Hurree Babu,"
rolling into the balcony to clean his teeth at a goglet. â I am of
"opeenion it is not your old gentlemanâ s precise releegion, but rather"
sub-variant of same. I have contributed rejected notes To Whom It May
Concern:  Asiatic Quarterly Review  on these subjects. Now it is
curious that the old gentleman himself is totally devoid of
releegiosity. He is not a damâ  particular.â 

â Do you know him?â 

Hurree Babu held up his hand to show he was engaged in the prescribed
rites that accompany tooth-cleaning and such things among decently bred
Bengalis. Then he recited in English an Arya-Somaj prayer of a
"theistical nature, and stuffed his mouth with  pan  and betel."

"â Oah yes. I have met him several times at Benares, and also at Buddh"
"Gaya, to interrogate him on releegious points and devil-worship. He is"
pure agnosticâ same as me.â 

"Huneefa stirred in her sleep, and Hurree Babu jumped nervously to the"
"copper incense-burner, all black and discoloured in morning-light,"
"rubbed a finger in the accumulated lamp-black, and drew it diagonally"
across his face.

â Who has died in thy house?â  asked Kim in the vernacular.

"â None. But she may have the Evil Eyeâ that sorceress,â  the Babu replied."

"â What dost thou do now, then?â "

"â I will set thee on thy way to Benares, if thou goest thither, and tell"
thee what must be known by Us.â 

"â I go. At what hour runs the  te-rain? â  He rose to his feet, looked"
round the desolate chamber and at the yellow-wax face of Huneefa as the
low sun stole across the floor. â Is there money to be paid that witch?â 

â No. She has charmed thee against all devils and all dangers in the
name of her devils. It was Mahbubâ s desire.â  In English: â He is highly
"obsolete,  I  think, to indulge in such supersteetion. Why, it is all"
ventri lo quy. Belly-speakâ eh?â 

"Kim snapped his fingers mechanically to avert whatever evilâ Mahbub, he"
"knew, meditated noneâ might have crept in through Huneefaâ s"
ministrations; and Hurree giggled once more. But as he crossed the room
"he was careful not to step in Huneefaâ s blotched, squat shadow on the"
boards. Witchesâ when their time is on themâ can lay hold of the heels of
a manâ s soul if he does that.

"â Now you must well listen,â  said the Babu when they were in the fresh"
air. â Part of these ceremonies which we witnessed they include supply
of effeecient amulet to those of our Department. If you feel in your
"neck you will find one small silver amulet, verree cheap. That is"
 ours . Do you understand?â 

"â Oah yes,  hawa-dilli  (a heart-lifter),â  said Kim, feeling at his"
neck.

"â Huneefa she makes them for two rupees twelve annas withâ oh, all sorts"
"of exorcisms. They are quite common, except they are partially black"
"enamel, and there is a paper inside each one full of names of local"
"saints and such things.  Thatt  is Huneefaâ s look-out, you see? Huneefa"
"makes them onlee for us, but in case she does not, when we get them we"
"put in, before issue, one small piece of turquoise. Mr Lurgan he gives"
them. There is no other source of supply; but it was me invented all
"this. It is strictly unoffeecial of course, but convenient for"
subordinates. Colonel Creighton he does not know. He is European. The
"turquoise is wrapped in the paper ... Yes, that is road to railway"
"station ... Now suppose you go with the lama, or with me, I hope, some"
"day, or with Mahbub. Suppose we get into a damâ -tight place. I am a"
fearful manâ most fearfulâ but I tell you I have been in damâ -tight
places more than hairs on my head. You say: â€˜I am Son of the Charm.â 
Verree good.â 

â I do not understand quite. We must not be heard talking English here.â 

â That is all raight. I am only Babu showing off my English to you. All
"we Babus talk English to show off;â  said Hurree, flinging his"
"shoulder-cloth jauntily. â As I was about to say, â€˜Son of the Charmâ "
"means that you may be member of the  Sat Bhai â the Seven Brothers,"
which is Hindi  and  Tantric. It is popularly supposed to be extinct
"Society, but I have written notes to show it is still extant. You see,"
"it is all my invention. Verree good.  Sat Bhai  has many members, and"
perhaps before they jolly-well-cut-your-throat they may give you just a
"chance of life. That is useful, anyhow. And moreover, these foolish"
nativesâ if they are not too excitedâ they always stop to think before
they kill a man who says he belongs to any speecific organization. You
"see? You say then when you are in tight place, â€˜I am Son of the Charmâ ,"
and you getâ perhapsâ ahâ your second wind. That is only in extreme
"instances, or to open negotiations with a stranger. Can you quite see?"
"Verree good. But suppose now, I, or any one of the Department, come to"
you dressed quite different. You would not know me at all unless I
"choose, I bet you. Some day I will prove it. I come as Ladakhi"
"traderâ oh, anythingâ and I say to you: â€˜You want to buy precious"
stones?â  You say: â€˜Do I look like a man who buys precious stones?â  Then
I say: â€˜Even verree poor man can buy a turquoise or  tarkeean .â â 

"â That is  kichree â vegetable curry,â  said Kim."

â Of course it is. You say: â€˜Let me see the  tarkeean .â  Then I say: â€˜It
"was cooked by a woman, and perhaps it is bad for your caste.â  Then you"
say: â€˜There is no caste when men go toâ look for  tarkeean .â  You stop a
"little between those words, â€˜toâ lookâ . That is thee whole secret. The"
little stop before the words.â 

Kim repeated the test-sentence.

"â That is all right. Then I will show you my turquoise if there is time,"
"and then you know who I am, and then we exchange views and documents"
and those-all things. And so it is with any other man of us. We talk
"sometimes about turquoises and sometimes about  tarkeean , but always"
"with that little stop in the words. It is verree easy. First, â€˜Son of"
"the Charmâ , if you are in a tight place. Perhaps that may help"
"youâ perhaps not. Then what I have told you about the  tarkeean , if you"
"want to transact offeecial business with a strange man. Of course, at"
"present, you have no offeecial business. You areâ ah ha!â supernumerary"
on probation. Quite unique specimen. If you were Asiatic of birth you
might be employed right off; but this half-year of leave is to make you
"de-Englishized, you see? The lama he expects you, because I have"
"demi-offeecially informed him you have passed all your examinations,"
and will soon obtain Government appointment. Oh ho! You are on
"acting-allowance, you see: so if you are called upon to help Sons of"
"the Charm mind you jolly-well try. Now I shall say good-bye, my dear"
"fellow, and I hope youâ ahâ will come out top-side all raight.â "

Hurree Babu stepped back a pace or two into the crowd at the entrance
of Lucknow station andâ was gone. Kim drew a deep breath and hugged
himself all over. The nickel-plated revolver he could feel in the bosom
"of his sad-coloured robe, the amulet was on his neck; begging-gourd,"
"rosary, and ghost-dagger (Mr Lurgan had forgotten nothing) were all to"
"hand, with medicine, paint-box, and compass, and in a worn old"
purse-belt embroidered with porcupine-quill patterns lay a monthâ s pay.
Kings could be no richer. He bought sweetmeats in a leaf-cup from a
"Hindu trader, and ate them with glad rapture till a policeman ordered"
him off the steps.




CHAPTER XI


Give the man who is not made
To his trade
"Swords to fling and catch again,"
"Coins to ring and snatch again,"
"Men to harm and cure again,"
Snakes to charm and lure againâ 
"Heâ ll be hurt by his own blade,"
"By his serpents disobeyed,"
"By his clumsiness bewrayed,â "
By the people mocked to scornâ 
So â tis not with juggler born!
"Pinch of dust or withered flower,"
"Chance-flung fruit or borrowed staff,"
"Serve his need and shore his power,"
"Bind the spell, or loose the laugh!"

" But a man who, etc. , Op. 15"

Followed a sudden natural reaction.

"â Now am I aloneâ all alone,â  he thought. â In all India is no one so"
"alone as I! If I die today, who shall bring the newsâ and to whom? If I"
"live and God is good, there will be a price upon my head, for I am a"
"Son of the Charmâ I, Kim.â "

"A very few white people, but many Asiatics, can throw themselves into a"
mazement as it were by repeating their own names over and over again to
"themselves, letting the mind go free upon speculation as to what is"
"called personal identity. When one grows older, the power, usually,"
"departs, but while it lasts it may descend upon a man at any moment."

â Who is Kimâ Kimâ Kim?â 

"He squatted in a corner of the clanging waiting-room, rapt from all"
"other thoughts; hands folded in lap, and pupils contracted to"
pin-points. In a minuteâ in another half-secondâ he felt he would arrive
"at the solution of the tremendous puzzle; but here, as always happens,"
"his mind dropped away from those heights with a rush of a wounded bird,"
"and passing his hand before his eyes, he shook his head."

"A long-haired Hindu  bairagi  (holy man), who had just bought a ticket,"
halted before him at that moment and stared intently.

"â I also have lost it,â  he said sadly. â It is one of the Gates to the"
"Way, but for me it has been shut many years.â "

"â What is the talk?â  said Kim, abashed."

â Thou wast wondering there in thy spirit what manner of thing thy soul
might be. The seizure came of a sudden.  I  know. Who should know but
I? Whither goest thou?â 

â Toward Kashi [Benares].â 

â There are no Gods there. I have proved them. I go to Prayag
[Allahabad] for the fifth timeâ seeking the Road to Enlightenment. Of
what faith art thou?â 

"â I too am a Seeker,â  said Kim, using one of the lamaâ s pet words."
â Thoughâ â he forgot his Northern dress for the momentâ â though Allah
alone knoweth what I seek.â 

The old fellow slipped the  bairagiâ s  crutch under his armpit and sat
down on a patch of ruddy leopardâ s skin as Kim rose at the call for the
Benares train.

"â Go in hope, little brother,â  he said. â It is a long road to the feet"
of the One; but thither do we all travel.â 

"Kim did not feel so lonely after this, and ere he had sat out twenty"
"miles in the crowded compartment, was cheering his neighbours with a"
string of most wonderful yarns about his own and his masterâ s magical
gifts.

"Benares struck him as a peculiarly filthy city, though it was pleasant"
to find how his cloth was respected. At least one-third of the
population prays eternally to some group or other of the many million
"deities, and so reveres every sort of holy man. Kim was guided to the"
"Temple of the Tirthankars, about a mile outside the city, near Sarnath,"
by a chance-met Punjabi farmerâ a Kamboh from Jullundur-way who had
"appealed in vain to every God of his homestead to cure his small son,"
and was trying Benares as a last resort.

"â Thou art from the North?â  he asked, shouldering through the press of"
"the narrow, stinking streets much like his own pet bull at home."

"â Ay, I know the Punjab. My mother was a pahareen, but my father came"
"from Amritzarâ by Jandiala,â  said Kim, oiling his ready tongue for the"
needs of the Road.

"â Jandialaâ Jullundur? Oho! Then we be neighbours in some sort, as it"
were.â  He nodded tenderly to the wailing child in his arms. â Whom dost
thou serve?â 

â A most holy man at the Temple of the Tirthankers.â 

"â They are all most holy andâ most greedy,â  said the Jat with bitterness."
â I have walked the pillars and trodden the temples till my feet are
"flayed, and the child is no whit better. And the mother being sick too"
"... Hush, then, little one ... We changed his name when the fever came."
"We put him into girlâ s clothes. There was nothing we did not do,"
exceptâ I said to his mother when she bundled me off to Benaresâ she
should have come with meâ I  said  Sakhi Sarwar Sultan would serve us
"best. We know His generosity, but these down-country Gods are"
strangers.â 

The child turned on the cushion of the huge corded arms and looked at
Kim through heavy eyelids.

"â And was it all worthless?â  Kim asked, with easy interest."

"â All worthlessâ all worthless,â  said the child, lips cracking with"
fever.

"â The Gods have given him a good mind, at leastâ  said the father"
proudly. â To think he should have listened so cleverly. Yonder is thy
Temple. Now I am a poor manâ many priests have dealt with meâ but my son
"is my son, and if a gift to thy master can cure himâ I am at my very"
witsâ  end.â 

"Kim considered for a while, tingling with pride. Three years ago he"
would have made prompt profit on the situation and gone his way without
"a thought; but now, the very respect the Jat paid him proved that he"
"was a man. Moreover, he had tasted fever once or twice already, and"
knew enough to recognize starvation when he saw it.

"â Call him forth and I will give him a bond on my best yoke, so that the"
child is cured.â 

Kim halted at the carved outer door of the temple. A white-clad Oswal
"banker from Ajmir, his sins of usury new wiped out, asked him what he"
did.

"â I am  chela  to Teshoo Lama, an Holy One from Bhotiyalâ within there."
He bade me come. I wait. Tell him.â 

"â Do not forget the child,â  cried the importunate Jat over his shoulder,"
and then bellowed in Punjabi; â O Holy Oneâ O disciple of the Holy Oneâ O
Gods above all the Worldsâ behold affliction sitting at the gate!â  That
cry is so common in Benares that the passers never turned their heads.

"The Oswal, at peace with mankind, carried the message into the darkness"
"behind him, and the easy, uncounted Eastern minutes slid by; for the"
"lama was asleep in his cell, and no priest would wake him. When the"
click of his rosary again broke the hush of the inner court where the
"calm images of the Arhats stand, a novice whispered, â Thy  chela  is"
"here,â  and the old man strode forth, forgetting the end of that prayer."

Hardly had the tall figure shown in the doorway than the Jat ran before
"him, and, lifting up the child, cried: â Look upon this, Holy One; and"
"if the Gods will, he livesâ he lives!â "

He fumbled in his waist-belt and drew out a small silver coin.

â What is now?â  The lamaâ s eyes turned to Kim. It was noticeable he
"spoke far clearer Urdu than long ago, under ZamZammah; but father would"
allow no private talk.

"â It is no more than a fever,â  said Kim. â The child is not well fed.â "

"â He sickens at everything, and his mother is not here.â "

"â If it be permitted, I may cure, Holy One.â "

"â What! Have they made thee a healer? Wait here,â  said the lama, and he"
"sat down by the Jat upon the lowest step of the temple, while Kim,"
"looking out of the corner of his eyes, slowly opened the little"
betel-box. He had dreamed dreams at school of returning to the lama as
a Sahibâ of chaffing the old man before he revealed himselfâ boyâ s dreams
"all. There was more drama in this abstracted, brow-puckered search"
"through the tabloid-bottles, with a pause here and there for thought"
"and a muttered invocation between whiles. Quinine he had in tablets,"
"and dark brown meat-lozengesâ beef most probably, but that was not  his "
"business. The little thing would not eat, but it sucked at a lozenge"
"greedily, and said it liked the salt taste."

"â Take then these six.â  Kim handed them to the man. â Praise the Gods,"
and boil three in milk; other three in water. After he has drunk the
"milk give him thisâ  (it was the half of a quinine pill), â and wrap him"
"warm. Give him the water of the other three, and the other half of this"
"white pill when he wakes. Meantime, here is another brown medicine that"
he may suck at on the way home.â 

"â Gods, what wisdom!â  said the Kamboh, snatching."

It was as much as Kim could remember of his own treatment in a bout of
autumn malariaâ if you except the patter that he added to impress the
lama.

â Now go! Come again in the morning.â 

"â But the priceâ the price,â  said the Jat, and threw back his sturdy"
"shoulders. â My son is my son. Now that he will be whole again, how"
shall I go back to his mother and say I took help by the wayside and
did not even give a bowl of curds in return?â 

"â They are alike, these Jats,â  said Kim softly. â The Jat stood on his"
"dunghill and the Kingâ s elephants went by. â€˜O driver,â  said he, â€˜what"
will you sell those little donkeys for?â â 

"The Jat burst into a roar of laughter, stifled with apologies to the"
lama. â It is the saying of my own country the very talk of it. So are
we Jats all. I will come tomorrow with the child; and the blessing of
the Gods of the Homesteadsâ who are good little Godsâ be on you both ...
"Now, son, we grow strong again. Do not spit it out, little Princeling!"
"King of my Heart, do not spit it out, and we shall be strong men,"
"wrestlers and club-wielders, by morning.â "

"He moved away, crooning and mumbling. The lama turned to Kim, and all"
the loving old soul of him looked out through his narrow eyes.

â To heal the sick is to acquire merit; but first one gets knowledge.
"That was wisely done, O Friend of all the World.â "

"â I was made wise by thee, Holy One,â  said Kim, forgetting the little"
play just ended; forgetting St Xavierâ s; forgetting his white blood;
"forgetting even the Great Game as he stooped, Mohammedan-fashion, to"
touch his masterâ s feet in the dust of the Jain temple. â My teaching I
owe to thee. I have eaten thy bread three years. My time is finished. I
am loosed from the schools. I come to thee.â 

â Herein is my reward. Enter! Enter! And is all well?â  They passed to
"the inner court, where the afternoon sun sloped golden across. â Stand"
"that I may see. So!â  He peered critically. â It is no longer a child,"
"but a man, ripened in wisdom, walking as a physician. I did wellâ I did"
well when I gave thee up to the armed men on that black night. Dost
thou remember our first day under Zam-Zammah?â 

"â Ay,â  said Kim. â Dost thou remember when I leapt off the carriage the"
first day I went toâ â 

â The Gates of Learning? Truly. And the day that we ate the cakes
together at the back of the river by Nucklao. Aha! Many times hast thou
"begged for me, but that day I begged for thee.â "

"â Good reason,â  quoth Kim. â I was then a scholar in the Gates of"
"Learning, and attired as a Sahib. Do not forget, Holy One,â  he went on"
playfully. â I am still a Sahibâ by thy favour.â 

"â True. And a Sahib in most high esteem. Come to my cell,  chela .â "

â How is that known to thee?â 

The lama smiled. â First by means of letters from the kindly priest whom
"we met in the camp of armed men; but he is now gone to his own country,"
"and I sent the money to his brother.â  Colonel Creighton, who had"
succeeded to the trusteeship when Father Victor went to England with
"the Mavericks, was hardly the Chaplainâ s brother. â But I do not well"
understand Sahibsâ  letters. They must be interpreted to me. I chose a
"surer way. Many times when I returned from my Search to this Temple,"
"which has always been a nest to me, there came one seeking"
"Enlightenmentâ a man from Lehâ that had been, he said, a Hindu, but"
wearied of all those Gods.â  The lama pointed to the Arhats.

"â A fat man?â  said Kim, a twinkle in his eye."

â Very fat; but I perceived in a little his mind was wholly given up to
useless thingsâ such as devils and charms and the form and fashion of
"our tea-drinkings in the monasteries, and by what road we initiated the"
"novices. A man abounding in questions; but he was a friend of thine,"
 chela . He told me that thou wast on the road to much honour as a
scribe. And I see thou art a physician.â 

"â Yes, that am Iâ a scribe, when I am a Sahib, but it is set aside when I"
come as thy disciple. I have accomplished the years appointed for a
Sahib.â 

"â As it were a novice?â  said the lama, nodding his head. â Art thou freed"
from the schools? I would not have thee unripe.â 

â I am all free. In due time I take service under the Government as a
scribeâ â 

â Not as a warrior. That is well.â 

â But first I come to wander with thee. Therefore I am here. Who begs
"for thee, these days?â  he went on quickly. The ice was thin."

"â Very often I beg myself; but, as thou knowest, I am seldom here,"
except when I come to look again at my disciple. From one end to
another of Hind have I travelled afoot and in the  te-rain . A great
"and a wonderful land! But here, when I put in, is as though I were in"
my own Bhotiyal.â 

He looked round the little clean cell complacently. A low cushion gave
"him a seat, on which he had disposed himself in the cross-legged"
attitude of the Bodhisat emerging from meditation; a black teak-wood
"table, not twenty inches high, set with copper tea-cups, was before"
"him. In one corner stood a tiny altar, also of heavily carved teak,"
"bearing a copper-gilt image of the seated Buddha and fronted by a lamp,"
"an incense-holder, and a pair of copper flower-pots."

â The Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House acquired merit by giving
"me these a year since,â  he said, following Kimâ s eye. â When one is far"
from oneâ s own land such things carry remembrance; and we must
reverence the Lord for that He showed the Way. See!â  He pointed to a
curiously-built mound of coloured rice crowned with a fantastic metal
ornament. â When I was Abbot in my own placeâ before I came to better
knowledge I made that offering daily. It is the Sacrifice of the
Universe to the Lord. Thus do we of Bhotiyal offer all the world daily
"to the Excellent Law. And I do it even now, though I know that the"
Excellent One is beyond all pinchings and pattings.â  He snuffed from
his gourd.

"â It is well done, Holy One,â  Kim murmured, sinking at ease on the"
"cushions, very happy and rather tired."

"â And also,â  the old man chuckled, â I write pictures of the Wheel of"
Life. Three days to a picture. I was busied on itâ or it may be I shut
my eyes a littleâ when they brought word of thee. It is good to have
"thee here: I will show thee my artâ not for prideâ s sake, but because"
thou must learn. The Sahibs have not  all  this worldâ s wisdom.â 

He drew from under the table a sheet of strangely scented yellow
"Chinese paper, the brushes, and slab of Indian ink. In cleanest,"
"severest outline he had traced the Great Wheel with its six spokes,"
"whose centre is the conjoined Hog, Snake, and Dove (Ignorance, Anger,"
"and Lust), and whose compartments are all the Heavens and Hells, and"
all the chances of human life. Men say that the Bodhisat Himself first
"drew it with grains of rice upon dust, to teach His disciples the cause"
of things. Many ages have crystallized it into a most wonderful
convention crowded with hundreds of little figures whose every line
carries a meaning. Few can translate the picture-parable; there are not
twenty in all the world who can draw it surely without a copy: of those
who can both draw and expound are but three.

"â I have a little learned to draw,â  said Kim. â But this is a marvel"
beyond marvels.â 

"â I have written it for many years,â  said the lama. â Time was when I"
could write it all between one lamp-lighting and the next. I will teach
thee the artâ after due preparation; and I will show thee the meaning of
the Wheel.â 

"â We take the Road, then?â "

â The Road and our Search. I was but waiting for thee. It was made plain
to me in a hundred dreamsâ notably one that came upon the night of the
day that the Gates of Learning first shut that without thee I should
"never find my River. Again and again, as thou knowest, I put this from"
"me, fearing an illusion. Therefore I would not take thee with me that"
"day at Lucknow, when we ate the cakes. I would not take thee till the"
"time was ripe and auspicious. From the Hills to the Sea, from the Sea"
"to the Hills have I gone, but it was vain. Then I remembered the"
 JÃ¢taka .â 

"He told Kim the story of the elephant with the leg-iron, as he had told"
it so often to the Jam priests.

"â Further testimony is not needed,â  he ended serenely. â Thou wast sent"
"for an aid. That aid removed, my Search came to naught. Therefore we"
"will go out again together, and our Search sure.â "

â Whither go we?â 

"â What matters, Friend of all the World? The Search, I say, is sure. If"
"need be, the River will break from the ground before us. I acquired"
"merit when I sent thee to the Gates of Learning, and gave thee the"
"jewel that is Wisdom. Thou didst return, I saw even now, a follower of"
"Sakyamuni, the Physician, whose altars are many in Bhotiyal. It is"
"sufficient. We are together, and all things are as they wereâ Friend of"
all the Worldâ Friend of the Starsâ my  chela! â 

Then they talked of matters secular; but it was noticeable that the
"lama never demanded any details of life at St Xavierâ s, nor showed the"
faintest curiosity as to the manners and customs of Sahibs. His mind
"moved all in the past, and he revived every step of their wonderful"
"first journey together, rubbing his hands and chuckling, till it"
pleased him to curl himself up into the sudden sleep of old age.

"Kim watched the last dusty sunshine fade out of the court, and played"
"with his ghost-dagger and rosary. The clamour of Benares, oldest of all"
"earthâ s cities awake before the Gods, day and night, beat round the"
"walls as the seaâ s roar round a breakwater. Now and again, a Jain"
"priest crossed the court, with some small offering to the images, and"
swept the path about him lest by chance he should take the life of a
"living thing. A lamp twinkled, and there followed the sound of a"
prayer. Kim watched the stars as they rose one after another in the
"still, sticky dark, till he fell asleep at the foot of the altar. That"
"night he dreamed in Hindustani, with never an English word..."

"â Holy One, there is the child to whom we gave the medicine,â  he said,"
"about three oâ clock in the morning, when the lama, also waking from"
"dreams, would have fared forth on pilgrimage. â The Jat will be here at"
the light.â 

â I am well answered. In my haste I would have done a wrong.â  He sat
down on the cushions and returned to his rosary. â Surely old folk are
"as children,â  he said pathetically. â They desire a matterâ behold, it"
"must be done at once, or they fret and weep! Many times when I was upon"
the Road I have been ready to stamp with my feet at the hindrance of an
"ox-cart in the way, or a mere cloud of dust. It was not so when I was a"
manâ a long time ago. None the less it is wrongfulâ â 

"â But thou art indeed old, Holy One.â "

"â The thing was done. A Cause was put out into the world, and, old or"
"young, sick or sound, knowing or unknowing, who can rein in the effect"
of that Cause? Does the Wheel hang still if a child spin itâ or a
"drunkard?  Chela , this is a great and a terrible world.â "

"â I think it good,â  Kim yawned. â What is there to eat? I have not eaten"
since yesterday even.â 

â I had forgotten thy need. Yonder is good Bhotiyal tea and cold rice.â 

â We cannot walk far on such stuff.â  Kim felt all the Europeanâ s lust
"for flesh-meat, which is not accessible in a Jain temple. Yet, instead"
"of going out at once with the begging-bowl, he stayed his stomach on"
"slabs of cold rice till the full dawn. It brought the farmer, voluble,"
stuttering with gratitude.

"â In the night the fever broke and the sweat came,â  he cried. â Feel"
"hereâ his skin is fresh and new! He esteemed the salt lozenges, and took"
"milk with greed.â  He drew the cloth from the childâ s face, and it"
"smiled sleepily at Kim. A little knot of Jain priests, silent but"
"all-observant, gathered by the temple door. They knew, and Kim knew"
"that they knew, how the old lama had met his disciple. Being courteous"
"folk, they had not obtruded themselves overnight by presence, word, or"
gesture. Wherefore Kim repaid them as the sun rose.

"â Thank the Gods of the Jains, brother,â  he said, not knowing how those"
Gods were named. â The fever is indeed broken.â 

â Look! See!â  The lama beamed in the background upon his hosts of three
years. â Was there ever such a  chela?  He follows our Lord the Healer.â 

"Now the Jains officially recognize all the Gods of the Hindu creed, as"
well as the Lingam and the Snake. They wear the Brahminical thread;
"they adhere to every claim of Hindu caste-law. But, because they knew"
"and loved the lama, because he was an old man, because he sought the"
"Way, because he was their guest, and because he collogued long of"
nights with the head-priestâ as free-thinking a metaphysician as ever
split one hair into seventyâ they murmured assent.

"â Remember,â â Kim bent over the childâ . â this trouble may come again.â "

"â Not if thou hast the proper spell,â  said the father."

â But in a little while we go away.â 

"â True,â  said the lama to all the Jains. â We go now together upon the"
Search whereof I have often spoken. I waited till my  chela  was ripe.
Behold him! We go North. Never again shall I look upon this place of my
"rest, O people of good will.â "

"â But I am not a beggar.â  The cultivator rose to his feet, clutching the"
child.

"â Be still. Do not trouble the Holy One,â  a priest cried."

"â Go,â  Kim whispered. â Meet us again under the big railway bridge, and"
"for the sake of all the Gods of our Punjab, bring foodâ curry, pulse,"
"cakes fried in fat, and sweetmeats. Specially sweetmeats. Be swift!â "

"The pallor of hunger suited Kim very well as he stood, tall and slim,"
"in his sand-coloured, sweeping robes, one hand on his rosary and the"
"other in the attitude of benediction, faithfully copied from the lama."
An English observer might have said that he looked rather like the
"young saint of a stained-glass window, whereas he was but a growing lad"
faint with emptiness.

"Long and formal were the farewells, thrice ended and thrice renewed."
The Seekerâ he who had invited the lama to that haven from far-away
"Tibet, a silver-faced, hairless asceticâ took no part in it, but"
"meditated, as always, alone among the images. The others were very"
"human; pressing small comforts upon the old manâ a betel-box, a fine new"
"iron pencase, a food-bag, and such-likeâ warning him against the dangers"
"of the world without, and prophesying a happy end to the Search."
"Meantime Kim, lonelier than ever, squatted on the steps, and swore to"
himself in the language of St Xavierâ s.

"â But it is my own fault,â  he concluded. â With Mahbub, I ate Mahbubâ s"
"bread, or Lurgan Sahibâ s. At St Xavierâ s, three meals a day. Here I"
"must jolly-well look out for myself. Besides, I am not in good"
"training.  How  I could eat a plate of beef now! ... Is it finished,"
Holy One?â 

"The lama, both hands raised, intoned a final blessing in ornate"
"Chinese. â I must lean on thy shoulder,â  said he, as the temple gates"
"closed. â We grow stiff, I think.â "

The weight of a six-foot man is not light to steady through miles of
"crowded streets, and Kim, loaded down with bundles and packages for the"
"way, was glad to reach the shadow of the railway bridge."

"â Here we eat,â  he said resolutely, as the Kamboh, blue-robed and"
"smiling, hove in sight, a basket in one hand and the child in the"
other.

"â Fall to, Holy Ones!â  he cried from fifty yards. (They were by the"
"shoal under the first bridge-span, out of sight of hungry priests.)"
"â Rice and good curry, cakes all warm and well scented with  hing "
"(asafÅ“tida), curds and sugar. King of my fields,â â this to the small"
sonâ â let us show these holy men that we Jats of Jullundur can pay a
service ... I had heard the Jains would eat nothing that they had not
"cooked, but trulyâ â he looked away politely over the broad riverâ â where"
there is no eye there is no caste.â 

"â And we,â  said Kim, turning his back and heaping a leafplatter for the"
"lama, â are beyond all castes.â "

They gorged themselves on the good food in silence. Nor till he had
licked the last of the sticky sweetstuff from his little finger did Kim
note that the Kamboh too was girt for travel.

"â If our roads lie together,â  he said roughly, â I go with thee. One does"
"not often find a worker of miracles, and the child is still weak. But I"
am not altogether a reed.â  He picked up his  lathi â a five-foot
male-bamboo ringed with bands of polished ironâ and flourished it in the
"air. â The Jats are called quarrel-some, but that is not true. Except"
"when we are crossed, we are like our own buffaloes.â "

"â So be it,â  said Kim. â A good stick is a good reason.â "

"The lama gazed placidly up-stream, where in long, smudged perspective"
the ceaseless columns of smoke go up from the burning-ghats by the
"river. Now and again, despite all municipal regulations, the fragment"
of a half-burned body bobbed by on the full current.

"â But for thee,â  said the Kamboh to Kim, drawing the child into his"
"hairy breast, â I might today have gone thitherâ with this one. The"
priests tell us that Benares is holyâ which none doubtâ and desirable to
"die in. But I do not know their Gods, and they ask for money; and when"
one has done one worship a shaved-head vows it is of none effect except
"one do another. Wash here! Wash there! Pour, drink, lave, and scatter"
"flowersâ but always pay the priests. No, the Punjab for me, and the soil"
of the Jullundur- doab  for the best soil in it.â 

"â I have said many timesâ in the Temple, I thinkâ that if need be, the"
"River will open at our feet. We will therefore go North,â  said the"
"lama, rising. â I remember a pleasant place, set about with fruit-trees,"
where one can walk in meditationâ and the air is cooler there. It comes
from the Hills and the snow of the Hills.â 

â What is the name?â  said Kim.

"â How should I know? Didst thou notâ no, that was after the Army rose out"
of the earth and took thee away. I abode there in meditation in a room
against the dovecotâ except when she talked eternally.â 

â Oho! the woman from Kulu. That is by Saharunpore.â  Kim laughed.

"â How does the spirit move thy master? Does he go afoot, for the sake of"
past sins?â  the Jat demanded cautiously. â It is a far cry to Delhi.â 

"â No,â  said Kim. â I will beg a  tikkut  for the  te-rain .â  One does not"
own to the possession of money in India.

"â Then, in the name of the Gods, let us take the fire-carriage. My son"
is best in his motherâ s arms. The Government has brought on us many
"taxes, but it gives us one good thingâ the  te-rain  that joins friends"
and unites the anxious. A wonderful matter is the  te-rain .â 

"They all piled into it a couple of hours later, and slept through the"
heat of the day. The Kamboh plied Kim with ten thousand questions as to
"the lamaâ s walk and work in life, and received some curious answers."
"Kim was content to be where he was, to look out upon the flat"
"North-Western landscape, and to talk to the changing mob of"
"fellow-passengers. Even today, tickets and ticket-clipping are dark"
"oppression to Indian rustics. They do not understand why, when they"
"have paid for a magic piece of paper, strangers should punch great"
"pieces out of the charm. So, long and furious are the debates between"
travellers and Eurasian ticket-collectors. Kim assisted at two or three
"with grave advice, meant to darken counsel and to show off his wisdom"
before the lama and the admiring Kamboh. But at Somna Road the Fates
"sent him a matter to think upon. There tumbled into the compartment, as"
"the train was moving off, a mean, lean little personâ a Mahratta, so far"
"as Kim could judge by the cock of the tight turban. His face was cut,"
"his muslin upper-garment was badly torn, and one leg was bandaged. He"
told them that a country-cart had upset and nearly slain him: he was
"going to Delhi, where his son lived. Kim watched him closely. If, as he"
"asserted, he had been rolled over and over on the earth, there should"
have been signs of gravel-rash on the skin. But all his injuries seemed
"clean cuts, and a mere fall from a cart could not cast a man into such"
"extremity of terror. As, with shaking fingers, he knotted up the torn"
cloth about his neck he laid bare an amulet of the kind called a
"keeper-up of the heart. Now, amulets are common enough, but they are"
"not generally strung on square-plaited copper wire, and still fewer"
amulets bear black enamel on silver. There were none except the Kamboh
"and the lama in the compartment, which, luckily, was of an old type"
"with solid ends. Kim made as to scratch in his bosom, and thereby"
lifted his own amulet. The Mahrattaâ s face changed altogether at the
"sight, and he disposed the amulet fairly on his breast."

"â Yes,â  he went on to the Kamboh, â I was in haste, and the cart, driven"
"by a bastard, bound its wheel in a water-cut, and besides the harm done"
to me there was lost a full dish of  tarkeean . I was not a Son of the
Charm [a lucky man] that day.â 

"â That was a great loss,â  said the Kamboh, withdrawing interest. His"
experience of Benares had made him suspicious.

â Who cooked it?â  said Kim.

â A woman.â  The Mahratta raised his eyes.

"â But all women can cook  tarkeean ,â  said the Kamboh. â It is a good"
"curry, as I know.â "

"â Oh yes, it is a good curry,â  said the Mahratta."

"â And cheap,â  said Kim. â But what about caste?â "

"â Oh, there is no caste where men go toâ look for  tarkeean ,â  the"
"Mahratta replied, in the prescribed cadence. â Of whose service art"
thou?â 

"â Of the service of this Holy One.â  Kim pointed to the happy, drowsy"
"lama, who woke with a jerk at the well-loved word."

"â Ah, he was sent from Heaven to aid me. He is called the Friend of all"
the World. He is also called the Friend of the Stars. He walks as a
physicianâ his time being ripe. Great is his wisdom.â 

"â And a Son of the Charm,â  said Kim under his breath, as the Kamboh made"
haste to prepare a pipe lest the Mahratta should beg.

"â And who is  that? â  the Mahratta asked, glancing sideways nervously."

"â One whose child Iâ we have cured, who lies under great debt to us. Sit"
"by the window, man from Jullundur. Here is a sick one.â "

â Humph!  I  have no desire to mix with chance-met wastrels.  My  ears
are not long.  I  am not a woman wishing to overhear secrets.â  The Jat
slid himself heavily into a far corner.

"â Art thou anything of a healer? I am ten leagues deep in calamity,â "
"cried the Mahratta, picking up the cue."

"â This man is cut and bruised all over. I go about to cure him,â  Kim"
retorted. â None interfered between thy babe and me.â 

"â I am rebuked,â  said the Kamboh meekly. â I am thy debtor for the life"
of my son. Thou art a miracle-workerâ I know it.â 

"â Show me the cuts.â  Kim bent over the Mahrattaâ s neck, his heart nearly"
"choking him; for this was the Great Game with a vengeance. â Now, tell"
"thy tale swiftly, brother, while I say a charm.â "

"â I come from the South, where my work lay. One of us they slew by the"
"roadside. Hast thou heard?â  Kim shook his head. He, of course, knew"
"nothing of Eâ s predecessor, slain down South in the habit of an Arab"
"trader. â Having found a certain letter which I was sent to seek, I came"
away. I escaped from the city and ran to Mhow. So sure was I that none
"knew, I did not change my face. At Mhow a woman brought charge against"
me of theft of jewellery in that city which I had left. Then I saw the
"cry was out against me. I ran from Mhow by night, bribing the police,"
who had been bribed to hand me over without question to my enemies in
"the South. Then I lay in old Chitor city a week, a penitent in a"
"temple, but I could not get rid of the letter which was my charge. I"
"buried it under the Queenâ s Stone, at Chitor, in the place known to us"
all.â 

"Kim did not know, but not for worlds would he have broken the thread."

"â At Chitor, look you, I was all in Kingsâ  country; for Kotah to the"
"east is beyond the Queenâ s law, and east again lie Jaipur and Gwalior."
"Neither love spies, and there is no justice. I was hunted like a wet"
"jackal; but I broke through at Bandakui, where I heard there was a"
charge against me of murder in the city I had leftâ of the murder of a
boy. They have both the corpse and the witnesses waiting.â 

â But cannot the Government protect?â 

"â We of the Game are beyond protection. If we die, we die. Our names are"
"blotted from the book. That is all. At Bandakui, where lives one of Us,"
"I thought to slip the scent by changing my face, and so made me a"
"Mahratta. Then I came to Agra, and would have turned back to Chitor to"
recover the letter. So sure I was I had slipped them. Therefore I did
not send a tar [telegram] to any one saying where the letter lay. I
wished the credit of it all.â 

Kim nodded. He understood that feeling well.

"â But at Agra, walking in the streets, a man cried a debt against me,"
"and approaching with many witnesses, would hale me to the courts then"
"and there. Oh, they are clever in the South! He recognized me as his"
agent for cotton. May he burn in Hell for it!â 

â And wast thou?â 

â O fool! I was the man they sought for the matter of the letter! I ran
"into the Fleshersâ  Ward and came out by the House of the Jew, who"
feared a riot and pushed me forth. I came afoot to Somna Roadâ I had
"only money for my  tikkut  to Delhiâ and there, while I lay in a ditch"
"with a fever, one sprang out of the bushes and beat me and cut me and"
searched me from head to foot. Within earshot of the  te-rain  it was!â 

â Why did he not slay thee out of hand?â 

â They are not so foolish. If I am taken in Delhi at the instance of
"lawyers, upon a proven charge of murder, my body is handed over to the"
"State that desires it. I go back guarded, and thenâ I die slowly for an"
example to the rest of Us. The South is not my country. I run in
circlesâ like a goat with one eye. I have not eaten for two days. I am
markedâ â he touched the filthy bandage on his legâ â so that they will
know me at Delhi.â 

"â Thou art safe in the  te-rain , at least.â "

â Live a year at the Great Game and tell me that again! The wires will
"be out against me at Delhi, describing every tear and rag upon me."
"Twentyâ a hundred, if need beâ will have seen me slay that boy. And thou"
art useless!â 

Kim knew enough of native methods of attack not to doubt that the case
would be deadly completeâ even to the corpse. The Mahratta twitched his
fingers with pain from time to time. The Kamboh in his corner glared
"sullenly; the lama was busy over his beads; and Kim, fumbling"
"doctor-fashion at the manâ s neck, thought out his plan between"
invocations.

â Hast thou a charm to change my shape? Else I am dead. Fiveâ ten minutes
"alone, if I had not been so pressed, and I mightâ â "

"â Is he cured yet, miracle-worker?â  said the Kamboh jealously. â Thou"
hast chanted long enough.â 

"â Nay. There is no cure for his hurts, as I see, except he sit for three"
"days in the habit of a  bairagi .â  This is a common penance, often"
imposed on a fat trader by his spiritual teacher.

"â One priest always goes about to make another priest,â  was the retort."
"Like most grossly superstitious folk, the Kamboh could not keep his"
tongue from deriding his Church.

"â Will thy son be a priest, then? It is time he took more of my"
quinine.â 

"â We Jats are all buffaloes,â  said the Kamboh, softening anew."

Kim rubbed a finger-tip of bitterness on the childâ s trusting little
"lips. â I have asked for nothing,â  he said sternly to the father,"
â except food. Dost thou grudge me that? I go to heal another man. Have
I thy leaveâ Prince?â 

Up flew the manâ s huge paws in supplication. â Nayâ nay. Do not mock me
thus.â 

â It pleases me to cure this sick one. Thou shalt acquire merit by
aiding. What colour ash is there in thy pipe-bowl? White. That is
auspicious. Was there raw turmeric among thy foodstuffs?â 

â Iâ Iâ â 

â Open thy bundle!â 

"It was the usual collection of small oddments: bits of cloth, quack"
"medicines, cheap fairings, a clothful of  atta â greyish, rough-ground"
"native flourâ twists of down-country tobacco, tawdry pipe-stems, and a"
"packet of curry-stuff, all wrapped in a quilt. Kim turned it over with"
"the air of a wise warlock, muttering a Mohammedan invocation."

"â This is wisdom I learned from the Sahibs,â  he whispered to the lama;"
"and here, when one thinks of his training at Lurganâ s, he spoke no more"
"than the truth. â There is a great evil in this manâ s fortune, as shown"
"by the Stars, whichâ which troubles him. Shall I take it away?â "

"â Friend of the Stars, thou hast done well in all things. Let it be at"
thy pleasure. Is it another healing?â 

â Quick! Be quick!â  gasped the Mahratta. â The train may stop.â 

"â A healing against the shadow of death,â  said Kim, mixing the Kambohâ s"
flour with the mingled charcoal and tobacco ash in the red-earth bowl
"of the pipe. E, without a word, slipped off his turban and shook down"
his long black hair.

"â That is my foodâ priest,â  the jat growled."

â A buffalo in the temple! Hast thou dared to look even thus far?â  said
Kim. â I must do mysteries before fools; but have a care for thine eyes.
"Is there a film before them already? I save the babe, and for return"
"thouâ oh, shameless!â  The man flinched at the direct gaze, for Kim was"
wholly in earnest.

"â Shall I curse thee, or shall Iâ â  He picked up the outer cloth of the"
bundle and threw it over the bowed head. â Dare so much as to think a
"wish to see, andâ andâ even I cannot save thee. Sit! Be dumb!â "

"â I am blindâ dumb. Forbear to curse! Coâ come, child; we will play a game"
"of hiding. Do not, for my sake, look from under the cloth.â "

"â I see hope,â  said E23. â What is thy scheme?â "

"â This comes next,â  said Kim, plucking the thin body-shirt. E23"
"hesitated, with all a North-West manâ s dislike of baring his body."

"â What is caste to a cut throat?â  said Kim, rending it to the waist. â We"
"must make thee a yellow Saddhu all over. Stripâ strip swiftly, and shake"
"thy hair over thine eyes while I scatter the ash. Now, a caste-mark on"
thy forehead.â  He drew from his bosom the little Survey paint-box and a
cake of crimson lake.

"â Art thou only a beginner?â  said E23, labouring literally for the dear"
"life, as he slid out of his body-wrappings and stood clear in the"
loin-cloth while Kim splashed in a noble caste-mark on the ash-smeared
brow.

"â But two days entered to the Game, brother,â  Kim replied. â Smear more"
ash on the bosom.â 

"â Hast thou metâ a physician of sick pearls?â  He switched out his long,"
"tight-rolled turban-cloth and, with swiftest hands, rolled it over and"
under about his loins into the intricate devices of a Saddhuâ s
cincture.

"â Hah! Dost thou know his touch, then? He was my teacher for a while. We"
must bar thy legs. Ash cures wounds. Smear it again.â 

"â I was his pride once, but thou art almost better. The Gods are kind to"
us! Give me  that .â 

It was a tin box of opium pills among the rubbish of the Jatâ s bundle.
"E23 gulped down a half handful. â They are good against hunger, fear,"
"and chill. And they make the eyes red too,â  he explained. â Now I shall"
have heart to play the Game. We lack only a Saddhuâ s tongs. What of the
old clothes?â 

"Kim rolled them small, and stuffed them into the slack folds of his"
tunic. With a yellow-ochre paint cake he smeared the legs and the
"breast, great streaks against the background of flour, ash, and"
turmeric.

"â The blood on them is enough to hang thee, brother.â "

â Maybe; but no need to throw them out of the window ... It is
finished.â  His voice thrilled with a boyâ s pure delight in the Game.
"â Turn and look, O Jat!â "

"â The Gods protect us,â  said the hooded Kamboh, emerging like a buffalo"
from the reeds. â Butâ whither went the Mahratta? What hast thou done?â 

"Kim had been trained by Lurgan Sahib; E23, by virtue of his business,"
"was no bad actor. In place of the tremulous, shrinking trader there"
"lolled against the corner an all but naked, ash-smeared, ochre-barred,"
"dusty-haired Saddhu, his swollen eyesâ opium takes quick effect on an"
"empty stomachâ luminous with insolence and bestial lust, his legs"
"crossed under him, Kimâ s brown rosary round his neck, and a scant yard"
"of worn, flowered chintz on his shoulders. The child buried his face in"
his amazed fatherâ s arms.

"â Look up, Princeling! We travel with warlocks, but they will not hurt"
"thee. Oh, do not cry ... What is the sense of curing a child one day"
and killing him with fright the next?â 

â The child will be fortunate all his life. He has seen a great healing.
When I was a child I made clay men and horses.â 

"â I have made them too. SÃ­r BanÃ¡s, he comes in the night and makes them"
"all alive at the back of our kitchen-midden,â  piped the child."

"â And so thou art not frightened at anything. Eh, Prince?â "

â I was frightened because my father was frightened. I felt his arms
shake.â 

"â Oh, chicken-man!â  said Kim, and even the abashed Jat laughed. â I have"
done a healing on this poor trader. He must forsake his gains and his
"account-books, and sit by the wayside three nights to overcome the"
malignity of his enemies. The Stars are against him.â 

"â The fewer money-lenders the better, say I; but, Saddhu or no Saddhu,"
he should pay for my stuff on his shoulders.â 

â So? But that is thy child on thy shoulderâ given over to the
burning-ghat not two days ago. There remains one thing more. I did this
charm in thy presence because need was great. I changed his shape and
"his soul. None the less, if, by any chance, O man from Jullundur, thou"
"rememberest what thou hast seen, either among the elders sitting under"
"the village tree, or in thine own house, or in company of thy priest"
"when he blesses thy cattle, a murrain will come among the buffaloes,"
"and a fire in thy thatch, and rats in the corn-bins, and the curse of"
our Gods upon thy fields that they may be barren before thy feet and
after thy ploughshare.â  This was part of an old curse picked up from a
 faquir  by the Taksali Gate in the days of Kimâ s innocence. It lost
nothing by repetition.

"â Cease, Holy One! In mercy, cease!â  cried the Jat. â Do not curse the"
household. I saw nothing! I heard nothing! I am thy cow!â  and he made
to grab at Kimâ s bare foot beating rhythmically on the carriage floor.
â But since thou hast been permitted to aid me in the matter of a pinch
of flour and a little opium and such trifles as I have honoured by
"using in my art, so will the Gods return a blessing,â  and he gave it at"
"length, to the manâ s immense relief. It was one that he had learned"
from Lurgan Sahib.

The lama stared through his spectacles as he had not stared at the
"business of disguisement. â Friend of the Stars,â  he said at last, â thou"
hast acquired great wisdom. Beware that it do not give birth to pride.
No man having the Law before his eyes speaks hastily of any matter
which he has seen or encountered.â 

"â Noâ noâ no, indeed,â  cried the farmer, fearful lest the master should be"
"minded to improve on the pupil. E23, with relaxed mouth, gave himself"
"up to the opium that is meat, tobacco, and medicine to the spent"
Asiatic.

"So, in a silence of awe and great miscomprehension, they slid into"
Delhi about lamp-lighting time.




CHAPTER XII


Who hath desired the Seaâ the sight of salt-water unbounded?
The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber
wind-hounded?
"The sleek-barrelled swell before stormâ grey, foamless, enormous, and"
growing?
Stark calm on the lap of the Lineâ or the crazy-eyed hurricane blowing?
His Sea in no showing the sameâ his Sea and the same â neath all showingâ 
His Sea that his being fulfils?
So and no otherwiseâ so and no otherwise Hill-men desire their Hills!

The Sea and the Hills.

"â I have found my heart again,â  said E23, under cover of the platformâ s"
"tumult. â Hunger and fear make men dazed, or I might have thought of"
this escape before. I was right. They come to hunt for me. Thou hast
saved my head.â 

"A group of yellow-trousered Punjab policemen, headed by a hot and"
"perspiring young Englishman, parted the crowd about the carriages."
"Behind them, inconspicuous as a cat, ambled a small fat person who"
looked like a lawyerâ s tout.

â See the young Sahib reading from a paper. My description is in his
"hand,â  said E23. â Thev go carriage by carriage, like fisher-folk"
netting a pool.â 

"When the procession reached their compartment, E23 was counting his"
beads with a steady jerk of the wrist; while Kim jeered at him for
being so drugged as to have lost the ringed fire-tongs which are the
"Saddhuâ s distinguishing mark. The lama, deep in meditation, stared"
"straight before him; and the farmer, glancing furtively, gathered up"
his belongings.

"â Nothing here but a parcel of holy-bolies,â  said the Englishman aloud,"
and passed on amid a ripple of uneasiness; for native police mean
extortion to the native all India over.

"â The trouble now,â  whispered E23, â lies in sending a wire as to the"
place where I hid that letter I was sent to find. I cannot go to the
 tar -office in this guise.â 

â Is it not enough I have saved thy neck?â 

â Not if the work be left unfinished. Did never the healer of sick
pearls tell thee so? Comes another Sahib! Ah!â 

"This was a tallish, sallowish District Superintendent of Policeâ belt,"
"helmet, polished spurs and allâ strutting and twirling his dark"
moustache.

â What fools are these Police Sahibs!â  said Kim genially.

"E23 glanced up under his eyelids. â It is well said,â  he muttered in a"
changed voice. â I go to drink water. Keep my place.â 

"He blundered out almost into the Englishmanâ s arms, and was bad-worded"
in clumsy Urdu.

â  Tum mut?  You drunk? You mustnâ t bang about as though Delhi station
"belonged to you, my friend.â "

"E23, not moving a muscle of his countenance, answered with a stream of"
"the filthiest abuse, at which Kim naturally rejoiced. It reminded him"
of the drummer-boys and the barrack-sweepers at Umballa in the terrible
time of his first schooling.

"â My good fool,â  the Englishman drawled. â  Nickle-jao!  Go back to your"
carriage.â 

"Step by step, withdrawing deferentially and dropping his voice, the"
"yellow Saddhu clomb back to the carriage, cursing the D.S.P. to"
"remotest posterity, byâ here Kim almost jumpedâ by the curse of the"
"Queenâ s Stone, by the writing under the Queenâ s Stone, and by an"
"assortment of Gods with wholly, new names."

"â I donâ t know what youâ re saying,â â the Englishman flushed angrilyâ â but"
itâ s some piece of blasted impertinence. Come out of that!â 

"E23, affecting to misunderstand, gravely produced his ticket, which the"
Englishman wrenched angrily from his hand.

"â Oh,  zoolum!  What oppression!â  growled the Jat from his corner. â All"
for the sake of a jest too.â  He had been grinning at the freedom of the
"Saddhuâ s tongue. â Thy charms do not work well today, Holy One!â "

"The Saddhu followed the policeman, fawning and supplicating. The ruck"
"of passengers, busy, with their babies and their bundles, had not"
noticed the affair. Kim slipped out behind him; for it flashed through
"his head that he had heard this angry, stupid Sahib discoursing loud"
personalities to an old lady near Umballa three years ago.

"â It is wellâ , the Saddhu whispered, jammed in the calling, shouting,"
bewildered pressâ a Persian greyhound between his feet and a cageful of
yelling hawks under charge of a Rajput falconer in the small of his
back. â He has gone now to send word of the letter which I hid. They
told me he was in Peshawur. I might have known that he is like the
crocodileâ always at the other ford. He has saved me from present
"calamity, but I owe my life to thee.â "

â Is he also one of Us?â  Kim ducked under a Mewar camel-driverâ s greasy
armpit and cannoned off a covey of jabbering Sikh matrons.

â Not less than the greatest. We are both fortunate! I will make report
to him of what thou hast done. I am safe under his protection.â 

"He bored through the edge of the crowd besieging the carriages, and"
squatted by the bench near the telegraph-office.

"â Return, or they take thy place! Have no fear for the work, brotherâ or"
"my life. Thou hast given me breathing-space, and Strickland Sahib has"
pulled me to land. We may work together at the Game yet. Farewell!â 

"Kim hurried to his carriage: elated, bewildered, but a little nettled"
in that he had no key to the secrets about him.

"â I am only a beginner at the Game, that is sure.  I  could not have"
leaped into safety as did the Saddhu. He knew it was darkest under the
lamp.  I  could not have thought to tell news under pretence of cursing
"... and how clever was the Sahib! No matter, I saved the life of one"
"... Where is the Kamboh gone, Holy One?â  he whispered, as he took his"
seat in the now crowded compartment.

"â A fear gripped him,â  the lama replied, with a touch of tender malice."
â He saw thee change the Mahratta to a Saddhu in the twinkling of an
"eye, as a protection against evil. That shook him. Then he saw the"
Saddhu fall sheer into the hands of the  polis â all the effect of thy
art. Then he gathered up his son and fled; for he said that thou didst
change a quiet trader into an impudent bandier of words with the
"Sahibs, and he feared a like fate. Where is the Saddhu?â "

"â With the  polis ,â  said Kim ... â Yet I saved the Kambohâ s child.â "

The lama snuffed blandly.

"â Ah,  chela , see how thou art overtaken! Thou didst cure the Kambohâ s"
child solely to acquire merit. But thou didst put a spell on the
Mahratta with prideful workingsâ I watched theeâ and with sidelong
glances to bewilder an old old man and a foolish farmer: whence
calamity and suspicion.â 

Kim controlled himself with an effort beyond his years. Not more than
"any other youngster did he like to eat dirt or to be misjudged, but he"
saw himself in a cleft stick. The train rolled out of Delhi into the
night.

"â It is true,â  he murmured. â Where I have offended thee I have done"
wrong.â 

"â It is more,  chela . Thou hast loosed an Act upon the world, and as a"
stone thrown into a pool so spread the consequences thou canst not tell
how far.â 

This ignorance was well both for Kimâ s vanity and for the lamaâ s peace
"of mind, when we think that there was then being handed in at Simla a"
"code-wire reporting the arrival of E23 at Delhi, and, more important,"
the whereabouts of a letter he had been commissioned toâ abstract.
"Incidentally, an over-zealous policeman had arrested, on charge of"
"murder done in a far southern State, a horribly indignant Ajmir"
"cotton-broker, who was explaining himself to a Mr Strickland on Delhi"
"platform, while E23 was paddling through byways into the locked heart"
of Delhi city. In two hours several telegrams had reached the angry
minister of a southern State reporting that all trace of a somewhat
bruised Mahratta had been lost; and by the time the leisurely train
halted at Saharunpore the last ripple of the stone Kim had helped to
heave was lapping against the steps of a mosque in far-away Roumâ where
it disturbed a pious man at prayers.

The lama made his in ample form near the dewy bougainvillea-trellis
"near the platform, cheered by the clear sunshine and the presence of"
"his disciple. â We will put these things behind us,â  he said, indicating"
the brazen engine and the gleaming track. â The jolting of the
 te-rain â though a wonderful thingâ has turned my bones to water. We
will use clean air henceforward.â 

"â Let us go to the Kulu womanâ s houseâ  said Kim, and stepped forth"
cheerily under the bundles. Early morning Saharunpore-way is clean and
"well scented. He thought of the other mornings at St Xavierâ s, and it"
topped his already thrice-heaped contentment.

â Where is this new haste born from? Wise men do not run about like
chickens in the sun. We have come hundreds upon hundreds of  kos 
"already, and, till now, I have scarcely been alone with thee an"
instant. How canst thou receive instruction all jostled of crowds? How
"can I, whelmed by a flux of talk, meditate upon the Way?â "

"â Her tongue grows no shorter with the years, then?â  the disciple"
smiled.

â Nor her desire for charms. I remember once when I spoke of the Wheel
of Lifeâ â the lama fumbled in his bosom for his latest copyâ â she was
only curious about the devils that besiege children. She shall acquire
"merit by entertaining usâ in a little whileâ at an after-occasionâ softly,"
"softly. Now we will wander loose-foot, waiting upon the Chain of"
Things. The Search is sure.â 

So they travelled very easily across and among the broad bloomful
"fruit-gardensâ by way of Aminabad, Sahaigunge, Akrola of the Ford, and"
"little Phulesaâ the line of the Siwaliks always to the north, and behind"
"them again the snows. After long, sweet sleep under the dry stars came"
"the lordly, leisurely passage through a waking villageâ begging-bowl"
"held forth in silence, but eyes roving in defiance of the Law from"
skyâ s edge to skyâ s edge. Then would Kim return soft-footed through the
soft dust to his master under the shadow of a mango-tree or the thinner
"shade of a white Doon  siris , to eat and drink at ease. At mid-day,"
"after talk and a little wayfaring, they slept; meeting the world"
refreshed when the air was cooler. Night found them adventuring into
new territoryâ some chosen village spied three hours before across the
"fat land, and much discussed upon the road."

There they told their taleâ a new one each evening so far as Kim was
"concernedâ and there were they made welcome, either by priest or"
"headman, after the custom of the kindly East."

"When the shadows shortened and the lama leaned more heavily upon Kim,"
"there was always the Wheel of Life to draw forth, to hold flat under"
"wiped stones, and with a long straw to expound cycle by cycle. Here sat"
the Gods on highâ and they were dreams of dreams. Here was our Heaven
and the world of the demi-Godsâ horsemen fighting among the hills. Here
"were the agonies done upon the beasts, souls ascending or descending"
the ladder and therefore not to be interfered with. Here were the
"Hells, hot and cold, and the abodes of tormented ghosts. Let the"
 chela  study the troubles that come from over-eatingâ bloated stomach
"and burning bowels. Obediently, then, with bowed head and brown finger"
"alert to follow the pointer, did the  chela  study; but when they came"
"to the Human World, busy and profitless, that is just above the Hells,"
his mind was distracted; for by the roadside trundled the very Wheel
"itself, eating, drinking, trading, marrying, and quarrellingâ all warmly"
"alive. Often the lama made the living pictures the matter of his text,"
"bidding Kimâ too readyâ note how the flesh takes a thousand shapes,"
"desirable or detestable as men reckon, but in truth of no account"
"either way; and how the stupid spirit, bond-slave to the Hog, the Dove,"
"and the Serpentâ lusting after betel-nut, a new yoke of oxen, women, or"
the favour of kingsâ is bound to follow the body through all the Heavens
"and all the Hells, and strictly round again. Sometimes a woman or a"
"poor man, watching the ritualâ it was nothing lessâ when the great yellow"
"chart was unfolded, would throw a few flowers or a handful of cowries"
upon its edge. It sufficed these humble ones that they had met a Holy
One who might be moved to remember them in his prayers.

"â Cure them if they are sick,â  said the lama, when Kimâ s sporting"
"instincts woke. â Cure them if they have fever, but by no means work"
charms. Remember what befell the Mahratta.â 

"â Then all Doing is evil?â  Kim replied, lying out under a big tree at"
"the fork of the Doon road, watching the little ants run over his hand."

â To abstain from action is wellâ except to acquire merit.â 

â At the Gates of Learning we were taught that to abstain from action
was unbefitting a Sahib. And I am a Sahib.â 

"â Friend of all the World,â â the lama looked directly at Kimâ â I am an old"
manâ pleased with shows as are children. To those who follow the Way
"there is neither black nor white, Hind nor Bhotiyal. We be all souls"
"seeking escape. No matter what thy wisdom learned among Sahibs, when we"
come to my River thou wilt be freed from all illusionâ at my side. Hai!
"My bones ache for that River, as they ached in the  te-rain;  but my"
"spirit sits above my bones, waiting. The Search is sure!â "

â I am answered. Is it permitted to ask a question?â 

The lama inclined his stately head.

"â I ate thy bread for three yearsâ as thou knowest. Holy One, whence"
cameâ ?â 

"â There is much wealth, as men count it, in Bhotiyal,â  the lama returned"
with composure. â In my own place I have the illusion of honour. I ask
for that I need. I am not concerned with the account. That is for my
"monastery. Ai! The black high seats in the monastery, and novices all"
in order!â 

"And he told stories, tracing with a finger in the dust, of the immense"
and sumptuous ritual of avalanche-guarded cathedrals; of processions
and devil-dances; of the changing of monks and nuns into swine; of holy
cities fifteen thousand feet in the air; of intrigue between monastery
"and monastery; of voices among the hills, and of that mysterious mirage"
"that dances on dry snow. He spoke even of Lhassa and of the Dalai Lama,"
whom he had seen and adored.

"Each long, perfect day rose behind Kim for a barrier to cut him off"
from his race and his mother-tongue. He slipped back to thinking and
"dreaming in the vernacular, and mechanically followed the lamaâ s"
"ceremonial observances at eating, drinking, and the like. The old manâ s"
mind turned more and more to his monastery as his eyes turned to the
"steadfast snows. His River troubled him nothing. Now and again, indeed,"
"he would gaze long and long at a tuft or a twig, expecting, he said,"
the earth to cleave and deliver its blessing; but he was content to be
"with his disciple, at ease in the temperate wind that comes down from"
"the Doon. This was not Ceylon, nor Buddh Gaya, nor Bombay, nor some"
grass-tangled ruins that he seemed to have stumbled upon two years ago.
"He spoke of those places as a scholar removed from vanity, as a Seeker"
"walking in humility, as an old man, wise and temperate, illumining"
"knowledge with brilliant insight. Bit by bit, disconnectedly, each tale"
"called up by some wayside thing, he spoke of all his wanderings up and"
"down Hind; till Kim, who had loved him without reason, now loved him"
"for fifty good reasons. So they enjoyed themselves in high felicity,"
"abstaining, as the Rule demands, from evil words, covetous desires; not"
"over-eating, not lying on high beds, nor wearing rich clothes. Their"
"stomachs told them the time, and the people brought them their food, as"
"the saying is. They were lords of the villages of Aminabad, Sahaigunge,"
"Akrola of the Ford, and little Phulesa, where Kim gave the soulless"
woman a blessing.

"But news travels fast in India, and too soon shuffled across the"
"crop-land, bearing a basket of fruits with a box of Kabul grapes and"
"gilt oranges, a white-whiskered servitorâ a lean, dry Ooryaâ begging them"
"to bring the honour of their presence to his mistress, distressed in"
her mind that the lama had neglected her so long.

â Now do I rememberâ â the lama spoke as though it were a wholly new
"proposition. â She is virtuous, but an inordinate talker.â "

"Kim was sitting on the edge of a cowâ s manger, telling stories to a"
village smithâ s children.

â She will only ask for another son for her daughter. I have not
"forgotten her,â  he said. â Let her acquire merit. Send word that we will"
come.â 

"They covered eleven miles through the fields in two days, and were"
overwhelmed with attentions at the end; for the old lady held a fine
"tradition of hospitality, to which she forced her son-in-law, who was"
under the thumb of his women-folk and bought peace by borrowing of the
"money-lender. Age had not weakened her tongue or her memory, and from a"
"discreetly barred upper window, in the hearing of not less than a dozen"
"servants, she paid Kim compliments that would have flung European"
audiences into unclean dismay.

"â But thou art still the shameless beggar-brat of the  parao ,â  she"
shrilled. â I have not forgotten thee. Wash ye and eat. The father of my
daughterâ s son is gone away awhile. So we poor women are dumb and
useless.â 

"For proof, she harangued the entire household unsparingly till food and"
"drink were brought; and in the eveningâ the smoke-scented evening,"
copper-dun and turquoise across the fieldsâ it pleased her to order her
palanquin to be set down in the untidy forecourt by smoky torchlight;
"and there, behind not too closely drawn curtains, she gossiped."

"â Had the Holy One come alone, I should have received him otherwise; but"
"with this rogue, who can be too careful?â "

"â Maharanee,â  said Kim, choosing as always the amplest title, â is it my"
fault that none other than a Sahibâ a  polis -sahibâ called the Maharanee
whose face heâ â  â Chutt! That was on the pilgrimage. When we travelâ thou
knowest the proverb.â 

â Called the Maharanee a Breaker of Hearts and a Dispenser of Delights?â 

â To remember that! It was true. So he did. That was in the time of the
bloom of my beauty.â  She chuckled like a contented parrot above the
sugar lump. â Now tell me of thy goings and comingsâ as much as may be
"without shame. How many maids, and whose wives, hang upon thine"
eyelashes? Ye hail from Benares? I would have gone there again this
"year, but my daughterâ we have only two sons. Phaii! Such is the effect"
of these low plains. Now in Kulu men are elephants. But I would ask thy
"Holy Oneâ stand aside, rogueâ a charm against most lamentable windy"
colics that in mango-time overtake my daughterâ s eldest. Two years back
he gave me a powerful spell.â 

"â Oh, Holy One!â  said Kim, bubbling with mirth at the lamaâ s rueful"
face.

â It is true. I gave her one against wind.â 

"â Teethâ teethâ teeth,â  snapped the old woman."

"â â€˜Cure them if they are sick,â â  Kim quoted relishingly, â€˜â but by no"
means work charms. Remember what befell the Mahratta.â â 

â That was two Rains ago; she wearied me with her continual
importunity.â  The lama groaned as the Unjust Judge had groaned before
"him. â Thus it comesâ take note, my  chela â that even those who would"
"follow the Way are thrust aside by idle women. Three days through, when"
"the child was sick, she talked to me.â "

"â Arre! and to whom else should I talk? The boyâ s mother knew nothing,"
and the fatherâ in the nights of the cold weather it wasâ â€˜Pray to the
"Gods,â  said he, forsooth, and turning over, snored!â "

â I gave her the charm. What is an old man to do?â 

â â€˜To abstain from action is wellâ except to acquire merit.â â 

"â Ah  chela , if thou desertest me, I am all alone.â "

"â He found his milk-teeth easily at any rate,â  said the old lady. â But"
all priests are alike.â 

"Kim coughed severely. Being young, he did not approve of her flippancy."
â To importune the wise out of season is to invite calamity.â 

â There is a talking  mynah â â the thrust came back with the
well-remembered snap of the jewelled fore-fingerâ â over the stables
which has picked up the very tone of the family priest. Maybe I forget
"honour to my guests, but if ye had seen  him  double his fists into his"
"belly, which was like a half-grown gourd, and cry: â€˜Here is the pain!â "
ye would forgive. I am half minded to take the  hakimâ s  medicine. He
"sells it cheap, and certainly it makes him fat as Shivâ s own bull.  He "
"does not deny remedies, but I doubted for the child because of the"
in-auspicious colour of the bottles.â 

"The lama, under cover of the monologue, had faded out into the darkness"
towards the room prepared.

"â Thou hast angered him, belike,â  said Kim."

"â Not he. He is wearied, and I forgot, being a grandmother. (None but a"
grandmother should ever oversee a child. Mothers are only fit for
"bearing.) Tomorrow, when he sees how my daughterâ s son is grown, he"
"will write the charm. Then, too, he can judge of the new  hakimâ s "
drugs.â 

"â Who is the  hakim , Maharanee?â "

"â A wanderer, as thou art, but a most sober Bengali from Daccaâ a master"
of medicine. He relieved me of an oppression after meat by means of a
"small pill that wrought like a devil unchained. He travels about now,"
"vending preparations of great value. He has even papers, printed in"
"Angrezi, telling what things he has done for weak-backed men and slack"
women. He has been here four days; but hearing ye were coming ( hakims 
"and priests are snake and tiger the world over) he has, as I take it,"
gone to cover.â 

"While she drew breath after this volley, the ancient servant, sitting"
"unrebuked on the edge of the torchlight, muttered: â This house is a"
"cattle-pound, as it were, for all charlatans andâ priests. Let the boy"
stop eating mangoes ... but who can argue with a grandmother?â  He
"raised his voice respectfully: â Sahiba, the  hakim  sleeps after his"
meat. He is in the quarters behind the dovecote.â 

Kim bristled like an expectant terrier. To outface and down-talk a
"Calcutta-taught Bengali, a voluble Dacca drug-vendor, would be a good"
"game. It was not seemly that the lama, and incidentally himself, should"
be thrown aside for such an one. He knew those curious bastard English
advertisements at the backs of native newspapers. St Xavierâ s boys
sometimes brought them in by stealth to snigger over among their mates;
for the language of the grateful patient recounting his symptoms is
"most simple and revealing. The Oorya, not unanxious to play off one"
"parasite against the other, slunk away towards the dovecote."

"â Yes,â  said Kim, with measured scorn. â Their stock-in-trade is a little"
coloured water and a very great shamelessness. Their prey are
broken-down kings and overfed Bengalis. Their profit is in childrenâ who
are not born.â 

"The old lady chuckled. â Do not be envious. Charms are better, eh?  I "
never gainsaid it. See that thy Holy One writes me a good amulet by the
morning.â 

"â None but the ignorant denyâ â a thick, heavy voice boomed through the"
"darkness, as a figure came to rest squattingâ â None but the ignorant"
deny the value of charms. None but the ignorant deny the value of
medicines.â 

â A rat found a piece of turmeric. Said he: â€˜I will open a grocerâ s
"shop,â â  Kim retorted."

"Battle was fairly joined now, and they heard the old lady stiffen to"
attention.

â The priestâ s son knows the names of his nurse and three Gods. Says he:
"â€˜Hear me, or I will curse you by the three million Great Ones.â â "
Decidedly this invisible had an arrow or two in his quiver. He went on:
â I am but a teacher of the alphabet. I have learned all the wisdom of
the Sahibs.â 

â The Sahibs never grow old. They dance and they play like children when
"they are grandfathers. A strong-backed breed,â  piped the voice inside"
the palanquin.

"â I have, too, our drugs which loosen humours of the head in hot and"
angry men.  SinÃ¡  well compounded when the moon stands in the proper
House; yellow earths I haveâ  arplan  from China that makes a man renew
"his youth and astonish his household; saffron from Kashmir, and the"
best salep of Kabul. Many people have died beforeâ â 

"â That I surely believe,â  said Kim."

â They knew the value of my drugs. I do not give  my  sick the mere ink
"in which a charm is written, but hot and rending drugs which descend"
and wrestle with the evil.â 

"â Very mightily they do so,â  sighed the old lady."

"The voice launched into an immense tale of misfortune and bankruptcy,"
"studded with plentiful petitions to the Government. â But for my fate,"
"which overrules all, I had been now in Government employ. I bear a"
"degree from the great school at Calcuttaâ whither, maybe, the son of"
this House shall go.â 

â He shall indeed. If our neighbourâ s brat can in a few years be made an
"F Aâ  (First Artsâ she used the English word, of which she had heard so"
"often), â how much more shall children clever as some that I know bear"
away prizes at rich Calcutta.â 

"â Never,â  said the voice, â have I seen such a child! Born in an"
"auspicious hour, andâ but for that colic which, alas! turning into black"
"cholers, may carry him off like a pigeonâ destined to many years, he is"
enviable.â 

"â  Hai mai! â  said the old lady. â To praise children is inauspicious, or"
"I could listen to this talk. But the back of the house is unguarded,"
"and even in this soft air men think themselves to be men, and women we"
"know ... The childâ s father is away too, and I must be  chowkedar "
(watchman) in my old age. Up! Up! Take up the palanquin. Let the
 hakim  and the young priest settle between them whether charms or
"medicine most avail. Ho! worthless people, fetch tobacco for the"
"guests, andâ round the homestead go I!â "

"The palanquin reeled off, followed by straggling torches and a horde of"
"dogs. Twenty villages knew the Sahibaâ her failings, her tongue, and her"
"large charity. Twenty villages cheated her after immemorial custom, but"
no man would have stolen or robbed within her jurisdiction for any gift
"under heaven. None the less, she made great parade of her formal"
"inspections, the riot of which could be heard half-way to Mussoorie."

"Kim relaxed, as one augur must when he meets another. The  hakim ,"
"still squatting, slid over his hookah with a friendly foot, and Kim"
pulled at the good weed. The hangers-on expected grave professional
"debate, and perhaps a little free doctoring."

â To discuss medicine before the ignorant is of one piece with teaching
"the peacock to sing,â  said the  hakim ."

"â True courtesy,â  Kim echoed, â is very often inattention.â "

"These, be it understood, were company-manners, designed to impress."

"â Hi! I have an ulcer on my leg,â  cried a scullion. â Look at it!â "

â Get hence! Remove!â  said the  hakim . â Is it the habit of the place to
pester honoured guests? Ye crowd in like buffaloes.â 

â If the Sahiba knewâ â  Kim began.

â Ai! Ai! Come away. They are meat for our mistress. When her young
Shaitanâ s colics are cured perhaps we poor people may be suffered toâ â 

â The mistress fed thy wife when thou wast in jail for breaking the
money-lenderâ s head. Who speaks against her?â  The old servitor curled
his white moustaches savagely in the young moonlight. â  I  am
responsible for the honour of this house. Go!â  and he drove the
underlings before him.

"Said the  hakim , hardly more than shaping the words with his lips:"
"â How do you do, Mister Oâ Hara? I am jolly glad to see you again.â "

"Kimâ s hand clenched about the pipe-stem. Anywhere on the open road,"
"perhaps, he would not have been astonished; but here, in this quiet"
"backwater of life, he was not prepared for Hurree Babu. It annoyed him,"
"too, that he had been hoodwinked."

â Ah ha! I told you at Lucknowâ  resurgam â I shall rise again and you
shall not know me. How much did you betâ eh?â 

"He chewed leisurely upon a few cardamom seeds, but he breathed"
uneasily.

"â But why come here, Babuji?â "

"â Ah!  Thatt  is the question, as Shakespeare hath it. I come to"
congratulate you on your extraordinary effeecient performance at Delhi.
Oah! I tell you we are all proud of you. It was verree neat and handy.
"Our mutual friend, he is old friend of mine. He has been in some"
damâ -tight places. Now he will be in some more. He told me; I tell Mr
Lurgan; and he is pleased you graduate so nicely. All the Department is
pleased.â 

"For the first time in his life, Kim thrilled to the clean pride (it can"
"be a deadly pitfall, none the less) of Departmental praiseâ ensnaring"
praise from an equal of work appreciated by fellow-workers. Earth has
"nothing on the same plane to compare with it. But, cried the Oriental"
"in him, Babus do not travel far to retail compliments."

"â Tell thy tale, Babu,â  he said authoritatively."

"â Oah, it is nothing. Onlee I was at Simla when the wire came in about"
"what our mutual friend said he had hidden, and old Creightonâ â  He"
looked to see how Kim would take this piece of audacity.

"â The Colonel Sahib,â  the boy from St Xavierâ s corrected."

"â  Of  course. He found me at a loose string, and I had to go down to"
Chitor to find that beastly letter. I do not like the Southâ too much
railway travel; but I drew good travelling allowance. Ha! Ha! I meet
"our mutual at Delhi on the way back. He lies quiett just now, and says"
"Saddhu-disguise suits him to the ground. Well, there I hear what you"
"have done so well, so quickly, upon the instantaneous spur of the"
"moment. I tell our mutual you take the bally bun, by Jove! It was"
splendid. I come to tell you so.â 

â Umm!â 

"The frogs were busy in the ditches, and the moon slid to her setting."
Some happy servant had gone out to commune with the night and to beat
upon a drum. Kimâ s next sentence was in the vernacular.

â How didst thou follow us?â 

â Oah. Thatt was nothing. I know from our mutual friend you go to
Saharunpore. So I come on. Red Lamas are not inconspicuous persons. I
"buy myself my drug-box, and I am very good doctor really. I go to"
"Akrola of the Ford, and hear all about you, and I talk here and talk"
there. All the common people know what you do. I knew when the
hospitable old lady sent the  dooli . They have great recollections of
the old lamaâ s visits here. I know old ladies cannot keep their hands
"from medicines. So I am a doctor, andâ you hear my talk?  I  think it is"
"verree good. My word, Mister Oâ Hara, they know about you and the lama"
for fifty milesâ the common people. So I come. Do you mind?â 

"â Babuji,â  said Kim, looking up at the broad, grinning face, â I am a"
Sahib.â 

â My dear Mister Oâ Haraâ â 

â And I hope to play the Great Game.â 

â You are subordinate to me departmentally at present.â 

â Then why talk like an ape in a tree? Men do not come after one from
"Simla and change their dress, for the sake of a few sweet words. I am"
not a child. Talk Hindi and let us get to the yolk of the egg. Thou art
hereâ speaking not one word of truth in ten. Why art thou here? Give a
straight answer.â 

"â That is so verree disconcerting of the Europeans, Mister Oâ Hara.  You "
should know a heap better at your time of life.â 

"â But I want to know,â  said Kim, laughing. â If it is the Game, I may"
help. How can I do anything if you  bukh  (babble) all round the shop?â 

"Hurree Babu reached for the pipe, and sucked it till it gurgled again."

"â Now I will speak vernacular. You sit tight, Mister Oâ Hara ... It"
concerns the pedigree of a white stallion.â 

â Still? That was finished long ago.â 

â When everyone is dead the Great Game is finished. Not before. Listen
to me till the end. There were Five Kings who prepared a sudden war
"three years ago, when thou wast given the stallionâ s pedigree by Mahbub"
"Ali. Upon them, because of that news, and ere they were ready, fell our"
Army.â 

â Ayâ eight thousand men with guns. I remember that night.â 

â But the war was not pushed. That is the Government custom. The troops
were recalled because the Government believed the Five Kings were
cowed; and it is not cheap to feed men among the high Passes. HilÃ¡s and
BunÃ¡râ Rajahs with gunsâ undertook for a price to guard the Passes
against all coming from the North. They protested both fear and
"friendship.â  He broke off with a giggle into English: â Of course, I"
"tell you this unoffeecially to elucidate political situation, Mister"
"Oâ Hara. Offeecially, I am debarred from criticizing any action of"
"superiors. Now I go on.â This pleased the Government, anxious to avoid"
"expense, and a bond was made for so many rupees a month that HilÃ¡s and"
BunÃ¡r should guard the Passes as soon as the Stateâ s troops were
"withdrawn. At that timeâ it was after we two metâ I, who had been selling"
"tea in Leh, became a clerk of accounts in the Army. When the troops"
"were withdrawn, I was left behind to pay the coolies who made new roads"
"in the Hills. This road-making was part of the bond between BunÃ¡r,"
"HilÃ¡s, and the Government.â "

â So? And then?â 

"â I tell you, it was jolly-beastly cold up there too, after summer,â "
said Hurree Babu confidentially. â I was afraid these BunÃ¡r men would
"cut my throat every night for thee pay-chest. My native sepoy-guard,"
they laughed at me! By Jove! I was such a fearful man. Nevar mind
thatt. I go on colloquially ... I send word many times that these two
"Kings were sold to the North; and Mahbub Ali, who was yet farther"
"North, amply confirmed it. Nothing was done. Only my feet were frozen,"
and a toe dropped off. I sent word that the roads for which I was
paying money to the diggers were being made for the feet of strangers
and enemies.â 

â For?â 

â For the Russians. The thing was an open jest among the coolies. Then I
was called down to tell what I knew by speech of tongue. Mahbub came
South too. See the end! Over the Passes this year after
snow-meltingâ â he shivered afreshâ â come two strangers under cover of
"shooting wild goats. They bear guns, but they bear also chains and"
levels and compasses.â 

â Oho! The thing gets clearer.â 

â They are well received by HilÃ¡s and BunÃ¡r. They make great promises;
"they speak as the mouthpiece of a Kaisar with gifts. Up the valleys,"
"down the valleys go they, saying, â€˜Here is a place to build a"
breastwork; here can ye pitch a fort. Here can ye hold the road against
an armyâ â the very roads for which I paid out the rupees monthly. The
"Government knows, but does nothing. The three other Kings, who were"
" not  paid for guarding the Passes, tell them by runner of the bad"
"faith of BunÃ¡r and HilÃ¡s. When all the evil is done, look youâ when"
these two strangers with the levels and the compasses make the Five
Kings to believe that a great army will sweep the Passes tomorrow or
"the next dayâ Hill-people are all foolsâ comes the order to me, Hurree"
"Babu, â€˜Go North and see what those strangers do.â  I say to Creighton"
"Sahib, â€˜This is not a lawsuit, that we go about to collect evidence.â â "
"Hurree returned to his English with a jerk: â â€˜By Jove,â  I said, â€˜why"
the dooce do you not issue demi-offeecial orders to some brave man to
"poison them, for an example? It is, if you permit the observation, most"
"reprehensible laxity on your part.â  And Colonel Creighton, he laughed"
at me! It is all your beastly English pride. You think no one dare
conspire! That is all tommy-rott.â 

"Kim smoked slowly, revolving the business, so far as he understood it,"
in his quick mind.

â Then thou goest forth to follow the strangers?â 

â No. To meet them. They are coming in to Simla to send down their horns
and heads to be dressed at Calcutta. They are exclusively sporting
"gentlemen, and they are allowed special faceelities by the Government."
"Of course, we always do that. It is our British pride.â "

â Then what is to fear from them?â 

"â By Jove, they are not black people. I can do all sorts of things with"
"black people, of course. They are Russians, and highly unscrupulous"
people. Iâ I do not want to consort with them without a witness.â 

â Will they kill thee?â 

"â Oah, thatt is nothing. I am good enough Herbert Spencerian, I trust,"
"to meet little thing like death, which is all in my fate, you know."
Butâ but they may beat me.â 

â Why?â 

Hurree Babu snapped his fingers with irritation. â Of  course  I shall
affeeliate myself to their camp in supernumerary capacity as perhaps
"interpreter, or person mentally impotent and hungree, or some such"
"thing. And then I must pick up what I can, I suppose. That is as easy"
"for me as playing Mister Doctor to the old lady. Onleeâ onleeâ you see,"
"Mister Oâ Hara, I am unfortunately Asiatic, which is serious detriment"
in some respects. And  all so I am Bengaliâ a fearful man.â 

"â God made the Hare and the Bengali. What shame?â  said Kim, quoting the"
proverb.

"â It was process of Evolution,  I  think, from Primal Necessity, but the"
"fact remains in all the  cui bono . I am, oh, awfully fearful!â I"
remember once they wanted to cut off my head on the road to Lhassa.
"(No, I have never reached to Lhassa.) I sat down and cried, Mister"
"Oâ Hara, anticipating Chinese tortures. I do not suppose these two"
"gentlemen will torture me, but I like to provide for possible"
contingency with European assistance in emergency.â  He coughed and spat
"out the cardamoms. â It is purely unoffeecial indent, to which you can"
"say â€˜No, Babuâ . If you have no pressing engagement with your old"
manâ perhaps you might divert him; perhaps I can seduce his fanciesâ I
should like you to keep in Departmental touch with me till I find those
sporting coves. I have great opeenion of you since I met my friend at
Delhi. And also I will embody your name in my offeecial report when
matter is finally adjudicated. It will be a great feather in your cap.
That is why I come really.â 

"â Humph! The end of the tale, I think, is true; but what of the"
fore-part?â 

â About the Five Kings? Oah! there is ever so much truth in it. A lots
"more than you would suppose,â  said Hurree earnestly. â You comeâ eh? I go"
from here straight into the Doon. It is verree verdant and painted
"meads. I shall go to Mussoorie to good old Munsoorie Pahar, as the"
gentlemen and ladies say. Then by Rampur into Chini. That is the only
"way they can come. I do not like waiting in the cold, but we must wait"
"for them. I want to walk with them to Simla. You see, one Russian is a"
"Frenchman, and I know my French pretty well. I have friends in"
Chandernagore.â 

"â  He  would certainly rejoice to see the Hills again,â  said Kim"
meditatively. â All his speech these ten days past has been of little
else. If we go togetherâ â 

"â Oah! We can be quite strangers on the road, if your lama prefers. I"
shall just be four or five miles ahead. There is no hurry for
"Hurreeâ that is an Europe pun, ha! ha!â and you come after. There is"
"plenty of time; they will plot and survey and map, of course. I shall"
"go tomorrow, and you the next day, if you choose. Eh? You go think on"
"it till morning. By Jove, it is near morning now.â  He yawned"
"ponderously, and with never a civil word lumbered off to his"
"sleeping-place. But Kim slept little, and his thoughts ran in"
Hindustani:

"â Well is the Game called great! I was four days a scullion at Quetta,"
waiting on the wife of the man whose book I stole. And that was part of
"the Great Game! From the Southâ God knows how farâ came up the Mahratta,"
playing the Great Game in fear of his life. Now I shall go far and far
"into the North playing the Great Game. Truly, it runs like a shuttle"
throughout all Hind. And my share and my joyâ â he smiled to the
darknessâ â I owe to the lama here. Also to Mahbub Aliâ also to Creighton
"Sahib, but chiefly to the Holy One. He is rightâ a great and a wonderful"
worldâ and I am Kimâ Kimâ Kimâ aloneâ one personâ in the middle of it all.
But I will see these strangers with their levels and chains...â 

"â What was the upshot of last nightâ s babble?â  said the lama, after his"
orisons.

â There came a strolling seller of drugsâ a hanger-on of the Sahibaâ s.
"Him I abolished by arguments and prayers, proving that our charms are"
worthier than his coloured waters.â 

"â Alas, my charms! Is the virtuous woman still bent upon a new one?â "

â Very strictly.â 

"â Then it must be written, or she will deafen me with her clamour.â  He"
fumbled at his pencase.

"â In the Plains,â  said Kim, â are always too many people. In the Hills,"
"as I understand, there are fewer.â "

"â Oh! the Hills, and the snows upon the Hills.â  The lami tore off a tiny"
square of paper fit to go in an amulet. â But what dost thou know of the
Hills?â 

"â They are very close.â  Kim thrust open the door and looked at the long,"
peaceful line of the Himalayas flushed in morning-gold. â Except in the
"dress of a Sahib, I have never set foot among them.â "

The lama snuffed the wind wistfully.

"â If we go North,â â Kim put the question to the waking sunriseâ â would not"
much mid-day heat be avoided by walking among the lower hills at least?
"... Is the charm made, Holy One?â "

â I have written the names of seven silly devilsâ not one of whom is
worth a grain of dust in the eye. Thus do foolish women drag us from
the Way!â 

Hurree Babu came out from behind the dovecote washing his teeth with
"ostentatious ritual. Full-fleshed, heavy-haunched, bull-necked, and"
"deep-voiced, he did not look like â a fearful manâ . Kim signed almost"
"imperceptibly that matters were in good train, and when the morning"
"toilet was over, Hurree Babu, in flowery speech, came to do honour to"
"the lama. They ate, of course, apart, and afterwards the old lady, more"
"or less veiled behind a window, returned to the vital business of"
"green-mango colics in the young. The lamaâ s knowledge of medicine was,"
"of course, sympathetic only. He believed that the dung of a black"
"horse, mixed with sulphur, and carried in a snake-skin, was a sound"
remedy for cholera; but the symbolism interested him far more than the
science. Hurree Babu deferred to these views with enchanting
"politeness, so that the lama called him a courteous physician. Hurree"
Babu replied that he was no more than an inexpert dabbler in the
mysteries; but at leastâ he thanked the Gods thereforeâ he knew when he
sat in the presence of a master. He himself had been taught by the
"Sahibs, who do not consider expense, in the lordly halls of Calcutta;"
"but, as he was ever first to acknowledge, there lay a wisdom behind"
earthly wisdomâ the high and lonely lore of meditation. Kim looked on
"with envy. The Hurree Babu of his knowledgeâ oily, effusive, and"
"nervousâ was gone; gone, too, was the brazen drug-vendor of overnight."
"There remainedâ polished, polite, attentiveâ a sober, learned son of"
"experience and adversity, gathering wisdom from the lamaâ s lips. The"
old lady confided to Kim that these rare levels were beyond her. She
"liked charms with plenty of ink that one could wash off in water,"
"swallow, and be done with. Else what was the use of the Gods? She liked"
"men and women, and she spoke of themâ of kinglets she had known in the"
past; of her own youth and beauty; of the depredations of leopards and
"the eccentricities of love Asiatic; of the incidence of taxation,"
"rack-renting, funeral ceremonies, her son-in-law (this by allusion,"
"easy to be followed), the care of the young, and the ageâ s lack of"
"decency. And Kim, as interested in the life of this world as she soon"
"to leave it, squatted with his feet under the hem of his robe, drinking"
"all in, while the lama demolished one after another every theory of"
body-curing put forward by Hurree Babu.

"At noon the Babu strapped up his brass-bound drug-box, took his"
"patent-leather shoes of ceremony in one hand, a gay blue-and-white"
"umbrella in the other, and set off northwards to the Doon, where, he"
"said, he was in demand among the lesser kings of those parts."

"â We will go in the cool of the evening,  chela ,â  said the lama. â That"
"doctor, learned in physic and courtesy, affirms that the people among"
"these lower hills are devout, generous, and much in need of a teacher."
In a very short timeâ so says the  hakim â we come to cool air and the
smell of pines.â 

"â Ye go to the Hills? And by Kulu road? Oh, thrice happy!â  shrilled the"
old lady. â But that I am a little pressed with the care of the
"homestead I would take palanquin ... but that would be shameless, and"
my reputation would be cracked. Ho! Ho! I know the roadâ every march of
the road I know. Ye will find charity throughoutâ it is not denied to
the well-looking. I will give orders for provision. A servant to set
you forth upon your journey? No ... Then I will at least cook ye good
food.â 

"â What a woman is the Sahiba!â  said the white-bearded Oorya, when a"
tumult rose by the kitchen quarters. â She has never forgotten a friend:
she has never forgotten an enemy in all her years. And her
cookeryâ wah!â  He rubbed his slim stomach.

"There were cakes, there were sweetmeats, there was cold fowl stewed to"
rags with rice and prunesâ enough to burden Kim like a mule.

"â I am old and useless,â  she said. â None now love meâ and none"
respectâ but there are few to compare with me when I call on the Gods
"and squat to my cooking-pots. Come again, O people of good will. Holy"
"One and disciple, come again. The room is always prepared; the welcome"
is always ready ... See the women do not follow thy  chela  too openly.
"I know the women of Kulu. Take heed,  chela , lest he run away when he"
smells his Hills again ... Hai! Do not tilt the rice-bag upside down
"... Bless the household, Holy One, and forgive thy servant her"
stupidities.â 

"She wiped her red old eyes on a corner of her veil, and clucked"
throatily.

"â Women talk,â  said the lama at last, â but that is a womanâ s infirmity."
I gave her a charm. She is upon the Wheel and wholly given over to the
"shows of this life, but none the less,  chela , she is virtuous,"
"kindly, hospitableâ of a whole and zealous heart. Who shall say she does"
not acquire merit?â 

"â Not I, Holy One,â  said Kim, reslinging the bountiful provision on his"
shoulders. â In my mindâ behind my eyesâ I have tried to picture such an
"one altogether freed from the Wheelâ desiring nothing, causing nothingâ a"
"nun, as it were.â "

"â And, O imp?â  The lama almost laughed aloud."

â I cannot make the picture.â 

"â Nor I. But there are many, many millions of lives before her. She will"
"get wisdom a little, it may be, in each one.â "

â And will she forget how to make stews with saffron upon that road?â 

â Thy mind is set on things unworthy. But she has skill. I am refreshed
all over. When we reach the lower hills I shall be yet stronger. The
 hakim  spoke truly to me this morn when he said a breath from the
snows blows away twenty years from the life of a man. We will go up
into the Hillsâ the high hillsâ up to the sound of snow-waters and the
sound of the treesâ for a little while. The  hakim  said that at any
"time we may return to the Plains, for we do no more than skirt the"
pleasant places. The  hakim  is full of learning; but he is in no way
proud. I spoke to himâ when thou wast talking to the Sahibaâ of a certain
"dizziness that lays hold upon the back of my neck in the night, and he"
said it rose from excessive heatâ to be cured by cool air. Upon
"consideration, I marvelled that I had not thought of such a simple"
remedy.â 

"â Didst thou tell him of thy Search?â  said Kim, a little jealously. He"
preferred to sway the lama by his own speechâ not through the wiles of
Hurree Babu.

"â Assuredly. I told him of my dream, and of the manner by which I had"
acquired merit by causing thee to be taught wisdom.â 

â Thou didst not say I was a Sahib?â 

â What need? I have told thee many times we be but two souls seeking
escape. He saidâ and he is just hereinâ that the River of Healing will
"break forth even as I dreamedâ at my feet, if need be. Having found the"
"Way, seest thou, that shall free me from the Wheel, need I trouble to"
find a way about the mere fields of earthâ which are illusion? That were
"senseless. I have my dreams, night upon night repeated; I have"
" JÃ¢taka;  and I have thee, Friend of all the World. It was written in"
thy horoscope that a Red Bull on a green fieldâ I have not
forgottenâ should bring thee to honour. Who but I saw that prophecy
"accomplished? Indeed, I was the instrument. Thou shalt find me my"
"River, being in return the instrument. The Search is sure!â "

"He set his ivory-yellow face, serene and untroubled, towards the"
beckoning Hills; his shadow shouldering far before him in the dust.




CHAPTER XIII


Who hath desired the Seaâ the immense and contemptuous surges?
"The shudder, the stumble, the swerve ere the star-stabbing bowsprit"
mergesâ 
The orderly clouds of the Trades and the ridged roaring sapphire
thereunderâ 
Unheralded cliff-lurking flaws and the head-sailsâ  low-volleying
thunder?
His Sea in no wonder the sameâ his Sea and the same in each wonderâ 
His Sea that his being fulfils?
So and no otherwiseâ so and no otherwise hill-men desire their hills!

The Sea and the Hills.

â Who goes to the hills goes to his mother.â 

"They had crossed the Siwaliks and the half-tropical Doon, left"
"Mussoorie behind them, and headed north along the narrow hill-roads."
"Day after day they struck deeper into the huddled mountains, and day"
after day Kim watched the lama return to a manâ s strength. Among the
"terraces of the Doon he had leaned on the boyâ s shoulder, ready to"
profit by wayside halts. Under the great ramp to Mussoorie he drew
"himself together as an old hunter faces a well-remembered bank, and"
"where he should have sunk exhausted swung his long draperies about him,"
"drew a deep double-lungful of the diamond air, and walked as only a"
"hillman can. Kim, plains-bred and plains-fed, sweated and panted"
"astonished. â This is  my  country,â  said the lama. â Beside Such-zen,"
"this is flatter than a rice-fieldâ ; and with steady, driving strokes"
from the loins he strode upwards. But it was on the steep downhill
"marches, three thousand feet in three hours, that he went utterly away"
"from Kim, whose back ached with holding back, and whose big toe was"
nigh cut off by his grass sandal-string. Through the speckled shadow of
the great deodar-forests; through oak feathered and plumed with ferns;
"birch, ilex, rhododendron, and pine, out on to the bare hillsidesâ "
"slippery sunburnt grass, and back into the woodlandsâ  coolth again,"
"till oak gave way to bamboo and palm of the valley, the lama swung"
untiring.

Glancing back in the twilight at the huge ridges behind him and the
"faint, thin line of the road whereby they had come, he would lay out,"
"with a hillmanâ s generous breadth of vision, fresh marches for the"
"morrow; or, halting in the neck of some uplifted pass that gave on"
"Spiti and Kulu, would stretch out his hands yearningly towards the high"
snows of the horizon. In the dawns they flared windy-red above stark
"blue, as Kedarnath and Badrinathâ kings of that wildernessâ took the"
"first sunlight. All day long they lay like molten silver under the sun,"
and at evening put on their jewels again. At first they breathed
"temperately upon the travellers, winds good to meet when one crawled"
"over some gigantic hogâ s-back; but in a few days, at a height of nine"
"or ten thousand feet, those breezes bit; and Kim kindly allowed a"
village of hillmen to acquire merit by giving him a rough blanket-coat.
The lama was mildly surprised that anyone should object to the
knife-edged breezes which had cut the years off his shoulders.

"â These are but the lower hills,  chela . There is no cold till we come"
to the true Hills.â 

"â Air and water are good, and the people are devout enough, but the food"
"is very bad,â  Kim growled; â and we walk as though we were madâ or"
"English. It freezes at night, too.â "

"â A little, maybe; but only enough to make old bones rejoice in the sun."
We must not always delight in soft beds and rich food.â 

â We might at least keep to the road.â 

"Kim had all a plainsmanâ s affection for the well-trodden track, not six"
"feet wide, that snaked among the mountains; but the lama, being"
"Tibetan, could not refrain from short cuts over spurs and the rims of"
"gravel-strewn slopes. As he explained to his limping disciple, a man"
"bred among mountains can prophesy the course of a mountain-road, and"
though low-lying clouds might be a hindrance to a short-cutting
"stranger, they made no earthly difference to a thoughtful man. Thus,"
after long hours of what would be reckoned very fair mountaineering in
"civilized countries, they would pant over a saddle-back, sidle past a"
"few landslips, and drop through forest at an angle of forty-five onto"
the road again. Along their track lay the villages of the hillfolkâ mud
"and earth huts, timbers now and then rudely carved with an axeâ clinging"
"like swallowsâ  nests against the steeps, huddled on tiny flats half-way"
down a three-thousand-foot glissade; jammed into a corner between
"cliffs that funnelled and focused every wandering blast; or, for the"
"sake of summer pasture, cowering down on a neck that in winter would be"
"ten feet deep in snow. And the peopleâ the sallow, greasy, duffle-clad"
"people, with short bare legs and faces almost Esquimauxâ would flock out"
and adore. The Plainsâ kindly and gentleâ had treated the lama as a holy
man among holy men. But the Hills worshipped him as one in the
confidence of all their devils. Theirs was an almost obliterated
"Buddhism, overlaid with a nature-worship fantastic as their own"
"landscapes, elaborate as the terracing of their tiny fields; but they"
"recognized the big hat, the clicking rosary, and the rare Chinese texts"
for great authority; and they respected the man beneath the hat.

"â We saw thee come down over the black Breasts of Eua,â  said a Betah who"
"gave them cheese, sour milk, and stone-hard bread one evening. â We do"
not use that oftenâ except when calving cows stray in summer. There is a
sudden wind among those stones that casts men down on the stillest day.
But what should such folk care for the Devil of Eua!â 

"Then did Kim, aching in every fibre, dizzy with looking down, footsore"
"with cramping desperate toes into inadequate crannies, take joy in the"
dayâ s marchâ such joy as a boy of St Xavierâ s who had won the
quarter-mile on the flat might take in the praises of his friends. The
"hills sweated the  ghi  and sugar suet off his bones; the dry air,"
"taken sobbingly at the head of cruel passes, firmed and built out his"
upper ribs; and the tilted levels put new hard muscles into calf and
thigh.

"They meditated often on the Wheel of Lifeâ the more so since, as the"
"lama said, they were freed from its visible temptations. Except the"
grey eagle and an occasional far-seen bear grubbing and rooting on the
hillside; a vision of a furious painted leopard met at dawn in a still
"valley devouring a goat; and now and again a bright-coloured bird, they"
were alone with the winds and the grass singing under the wind. The
women of the smoky huts over whose roofs the two walked as they
"descended the mountains, were unlovely and unclean, wives of many"
"husbands, and afflicted with goitre. The men were woodcutters when they"
"were not farmersâ meek, and of an incredible simplicity. But that"
"suitable discourse might not fail, Fate sent them, overtaking and"
"overtaken upon the road, the courteous Dacca physician, who paid for"
his food in ointments good for goitre and counsels that restore peace
between men and women. He seemed to know these hills as well as he knew
"the hill dialects, and gave the lama the lie of the land towards Ladakh"
and Tibet. He said they could return to the Plains at any moment.
"Meantime, for such as loved mountains, yonder road might amuse. This"
"was not all revealed in a breath, but at evening encounters on the"
"stone threshing-floors, when, patients disposed of, the doctor would"
"smoke and the lama snuff, while Kim watched the wee cows grazing on the"
"housetops, or threw his soul after his eyes across the deep blue gulfs"
"between range and range. And there were talks apart in the dark woods,"
"when the doctor would seek herbs, and Kim, as budding physician, must"
accompany him.

"â You see, Mister Oâ Hara, I do not know what the deuce-anâ  all I shall"
do when I find our sporting friends; but if you will kindly keep within
"sight of my umbrella, which is fine fixed point for cadastral survey, I"
shall feel much better.â 

"Kim looked out across the jungle of peaks. â This is not my country,"
" hakim . Easier, I think, to find one louse in a bear-skin.â "

"â Oah, thatt is my strong points. There is no hurry for Hurree. They"
were at Leh not so long ago. They said they had come down from the
Karakorum with their heads and horns and all. I am onlee afraid they
will have sent back all their letters and compromising things from Leh
into Russian territoree. Of course they will walk away as far to the
East as possibleâ just to show that they were never among the Western
States. You do not know the Hills?â  He scratched with a twig on the
earth. â Look! They should have come in by Srinagar or Abbottabad.
 Thatt  is their short roadâ down the river by Bunji and Astor. But they
have made mischief in the West. Soâ â he drew a furrow from left to
rightâ â they march and they march away East to Leh (ah! it is cold
"there), and down the Indus to HanlÃ© (I know that road), and then down,"
"you see, to Bushahr and Chini valley. That is ascertained by process of"
"elimination, and also by asking questions from people that I cure so"
well. Our friends have been a long time playing about and producing
impressions. So they are well known from far off. You will see me catch
them somewhere in Chini valley. Please keep your eye on the umbrella.â 

It nodded like a wind-blown harebell down the valleys and round the
"mountain sides, and in due time the lama and Kim, who steered by"
"compass, would overhaul it, vending ointments and powders at eventide."
â We came by such and such a way!â  The lama would throw a careless
"finger backward at the ridges, and the umbrella would expend itself in"
compliments.

"They crossed a snowy pass in cold moonlight, when the lama, mildly"
"chaffing Kim, went through up to his knees, like a Bactrian camelâ the"
"snow-bred, shag-haired sort that came into the Kashmir Serai. They"
"dipped across beds of light snow and snow-powdered shale, where they"
"took refuge from a gale in a camp of Tibetans hurrying down tiny sheep,"
each laden with a bag of borax. They came out upon grassy shoulders
"still snow-speckled, and through forest, to grass anew. For all their"
"marchings, Kedarnath and Badrinath were not impressed; and it was only"
"after days of travel that Kim, uplifted upon some insignificant"
"ten-thousand-foot hummock, could see that a shoulder-knot or horn of"
the two great lords hadâ ever so slightlyâ changed outline.

At last they entered a world within a worldâ a valley of leagues where
the high hills were fashioned of a mere rubble and refuse from off the
"knees of the mountains. Here one dayâ s march carried them no farther,"
"it seemed, than a dreamerâ s clogged pace bears him in a nightmare. They"
"skirted a shoulder painfully for hours, and, behold, it was but an"
outlying boss in an outlying buttress of the main pile! A rounded
"meadow revealed itself, when they had reached it, for a vast tableland"
"running far into the valley. Three days later, it was a dim fold in the"
earth to southward.

"â Surely the Gods live here!â  said Kim, beaten down by the silence and"
the appalling sweep and dispersal of the cloud-shadows after rain.
â This is no place for men!â 

"â Long and long ago,â  said the lama, as to himself, â it was asked of the"
Lord whether the world were everlasting. On this the Excellent One
"returned no answer ... When I was in Ceylon, a wise Seeker confirmed"
"that from the gospel which is written in Pali. Certainly, since we know"
"the way to Freedom, the question were unprofitable, butâ look, and know"
"illusion,  chela!  Theseâ are the true Hills! They are like my hills by"
Suchzen. Never were such hills!â 

"Above them, still enormously above them, earth towered away towards the"
"snow-line, where from east to west across hundreds of miles, ruled as"
"with a ruler, the last of the bold birches stopped. Above that, in"
"scarps and blocks upheaved, the rocks strove to fight their heads above"
"the white smother. Above these again, changeless since the worldâ s"
"beginning, but changing to every mood of sun and cloud, lay out the"
eternal snow. They could see blots and blurs on its face where storm
"and wandering wullie-wa got up to dance. Below them, as they stood, the"
forest slid away in a sheet of blue-green for mile upon mile; below the
forest was a village in its sprinkle of terraced fields and steep
"grazing-grounds. Below the village they knew, though a thunderstorm"
"worried and growled there for the moment, a pitch of twelve or fifteen"
hundred feet gave to the moist valley where the streams gather that are
the mothers of young Sutluj.

"As usual, the lama had led Kim by cow-track and by-road, far from the"
"main route along which Hurree Babu, that â fearful manâ , had bucketed"
three days before through a storm to which nine Englishmen out of ten
would have given full right of way. Hurree was no game-shotâ the snick
"of a trigger made him change colourâ but, as he himself would have said,"
"he was â fairly effeecient stalkerâ , and he had raked the huge valley"
"with a pair of cheap binoculars to some purpose. Moreover, the white of"
worn canvas tents against green carries far. Hurree Babu had seen all
"he wanted to see when he sat on the threshing-floor of Ziglaur, twenty"
"miles away as the eagle flies, and forty by roadâ that is to say, two"
"small dots which one day were just below the snow-line, and the next"
had moved downward perhaps six inches on the hillside. Once cleaned out
"and set to the work, his fat bare legs could cover a surprising amount"
"of ground, and this was the reason why, while Kim and the lama lay in a"
"leaky hut at Ziglaur till the storm should be over-past, an oily, wet,"
"but always smiling Bengali, talking the best of English with the vilest"
"of phrases, was ingratiating himself with two sodden and rather"
"rheumatic foreigners. He had arrived, revolving many wild schemes, on"
the heels of a thunderstorm which had split a pine over against their
"camp, and so convinced a dozen or two forcibly impressed"
baggage-coolies the day was inauspicious for farther travel that with
one accord they had thrown down their loads and jibbed. They were
"subjects of a Hill Rajah who farmed out their services, as is the"
"custom, for his private gain; and, to add to their personal distresses,"
the strange Sahibs had already threatened them with rifles. The most of
them knew rifles and Sahibs of old: they were trackers and  shikarris 
"of the Northern valleys, keen after bear and wild goat; but they had"
never been thus treated in their lives. So the forest took them to her
"bosom, and, for all oaths and clamour, refused to restore. There was no"
need to feign madness orâ the Babu had thought of another means of
"securing a welcome. He wrung out his wet clothes, slipped on his"
"patent-leather shoes, opened the blue-and-white umbrella, and with"
mincing gait and a heart beating against his tonsils appeared as â agent
"for His Royal Highness, the Rajah of Rampur, gentlemen. What can I do"
"for you, please?â "

"The gentlemen were delighted. One was visibly French, the other"
"Russian, but they spoke English not much inferior to the Babuâ s. They"
begged his kind offices. Their native servants had gone sick at Leh.
They had hurried on because they were anxious to bring the spoils of
the chase to Simla ere the skins grew moth-eaten. They bore a general
letter of introduction (the Babu salaamed to it orientally) to all
"Government officials. No, they had not met any other shooting-parties"
 en route . They did for themselves. They had plenty of supplies. They
only wished to push on as soon as might be. At this he waylaid a
"cowering hillman among the trees, and after three minutesâ  talk and a"
"little silver (one cannot be economical upon State service, though"
Hurreeâ s heart bled at the waste) the eleven coolies and the three
hangers-on reappeared. At least the Babu would be a witness to their
oppression.

"â My royal master, he will be much annoyed, but these people are onlee"
common people and grossly ignorant. If your honours will kindly
"overlook unfortunate affair, I shall be much pleased. In a little while"
"rain will stop and we can then proceed. You have been shooting, eh?"
That is fine performance!â 

"He skipped nimbly from one  kilta  to the next, making pretence to"
"adjust each conical basket. The Englishman is not, as a rule, familiar"
"with the Asiatic, but he would not strike across the wrist a kindly"
Babu who had accidentally upset a  kilta  with a red oilskin top. On
"the other hand, he would not press drink upon a Babu were he never so"
"friendly, nor would he invite him to meat. The strangers did all these"
"things, and asked many questionsâ about women mostlyâ to which Hurree"
returned gay and unstudied answers. They gave him a glass of whitish
"fluid like to gin, and then more; and in a little time his gravity"
"departed from him. He became thickly treasonous, and spoke in terms of"
sweeping indecency of a Government which had forced upon him a white
manâ s education and neglected to supply him with a white manâ s salary.
He babbled tales of oppression and wrong till the tears ran down his
"cheeks for the miseries of his land. Then he staggered off, singing"
"love-songs of Lower Bengal, and collapsed upon a wet tree-trunk. Never"
was so unfortunate a product of English rule in India more unhappily
thrust upon aliens.

"â They are all just of that pattern,â  said one sportsman to the other in"
French. â When we get into India proper thou wilt see. I should like to
visit his Rajah. One might speak the good word there. It is possible
that he has heard of us and wishes to signify his good-will.â 

"â We have not time. We must get into Simla as soon as may be,â  his"
"companion replied. â For my own part, I wish our reports had been sent"
"back from HilÃ¡s, or even Leh.â "

â The English post is better and safer. Remember we are given all
facilitiesâ and Name of God!â they give them to us too! Is it
unbelievable stupidity?â 

â It is prideâ pride that deserves and will receive punishment.â 

â Yes! To fight a fellow-Continental in our game is something. There is
"a risk attached, but these peopleâ bah! It is too easy.â "

"â Prideâ all pride, my friend.â "

â Now what the deuce is good of Chandernagore being so close to Calcutta
"and all,â  said Hurree, snoring open-mouthed on the sodden moss, â if I"
cannot understand their French? They talk so par tic ularly fast! It
would have been much better to cut their beastly throats.â 

"When he presented himself again he was racked with a headacheâ penitent,"
and volubly afraid that in his drunkenness he might have been
indiscreet. He loved the British Governmentâ it was the source of all
"prosperity and honour, and his master at Rampur held the very same"
"opinion. Upon this the men began to deride him and to quote past words,"
"till step by step, with deprecating smirks, oily grins, and leers of"
"infinite cunning, the poor Babu was beaten out of his defences and"
"forced to speakâ truth. When Lurgan was told the tale later, he mourned"
"aloud that he could not have been in the place of the stubborn,"
"inattentive coolies, who with grass mats over their heads and the"
"raindrops puddling in their footprints, waited on the weather. All the"
Sahibs of their acquaintanceâ rough-clad men joyously returning year
after year to their chosen gulliesâ had servants and cooks and
"orderlies, very often hillmen. These Sahibs travelled without any"
"retinue. Therefore they were poor Sahibs, and ignorant; for no Sahib in"
"his senses would follow a Bengaliâ s advice. But the Bengali, appearing"
"from somewhere, had given them money, and could make shift with their"
"dialect. Used to comprehensive ill-treatment from their own colour,"
"they suspected a trap somewhere, and stood by to run if occasion"
offered.

"Then through the new-washed air, steaming with delicious earth-smells,"
the Babu led the way down the slopesâ walking ahead of the coolies in
pride; walking behind the foreigners in humility. His thoughts were
many and various. The least of them would have interested his
"companions beyond words. But he was an agreeable guide, ever keen to"
point out the beauties of his royal masterâ s domain. He peopled the
"hills with anything thev had a mind to slayâ thar, ibex, or markhor, and"
bear by Elishaâ s allowance. He discoursed of botany and ethnology with
"unimpeachable inaccuracy, and his store of local legendsâ he had been a"
"trusted agent of the State for fifteen years, rememberâ was"
inexhaustible.

"â Decidedly this fellow is an original,â  said the taller of the two"
foreigners. â He is like the nightmare of a Viennese courier.â 

â He represents  in petto  India in transitionâ the monstrous hybridism
"of East and West,â  the Russian replied. â It is  we  who can deal with"
Orientals.â 

â He has lost his own country and has not acquired any other. But he has
a most complete hatred of his conquerors. Listen. He confided to me
"last night,â  said the other."

Under the striped umbrella Hurree Babu was straining ear and brain to
"follow the quick-poured French, and keeping both eyes on a  kilta  full"
of maps and documentsâ an extra-large one with a double red oil-skin
cover. He did not wish to steal anything. He only desired to know what
"to steal, and, incidentally, how to get away when he had stolen it. He"
"thanked all the Gods of Hindustan, and Herbert Spencer, that there"
remained some valuables to steal.

On the second day the road rose steeply to a grass spur above the
"forest; and it was here, about sunset, that they came across an aged"
lamaâ but they called him a bonzeâ sitting cross-legged above a
"mysterious chart held down by stones, which he was explaining to a"
"young man, evidently a neophyte, of singular, though unwashen, beauty."
"The striped umbrella had been sighted half a march away, and Kim had"
suggested a halt till it came up to them.

"â Ha!â  said Hurree Babu, resourceful as Puss-in-Boots. â That is eminent"
local holy man. Probably subject of my royal master.â 

â What is he doing? It is very curious.â 

â He is expounding holy pictureâ  all  hand-worked.â 

The two men stood bareheaded in the wash of the afternoon sunlight low
"across the gold-coloured grass. The sullen coolies, glad of the check,"
halted and slid down their loads.

â Look!â  said the Frenchman. â It is like a picture for the birth of a
religionâ the first teacher and the first disciple. Is he a Buddhist?â 

"â Of some debased kind,â  the other answered. â There are no true"
Buddhists among the Hills. But look at the folds of the drapery. Look
at his eyesâ how insolent! Why does this make one feel that we are so
young a people?â  The speaker struck passionately at a tall weed. â We
"have nowhere left our mark yet. Nowhere!  That , do you understand, is"
"what disquiets me.â  He scowled at the placid face, and the monumental"
calm of the pose.

â Have patience. We shall make your mark togetherâ we and you young
"people. Meantime, draw his picture.â "

The Babu advanced loftily; his back out of all keeping with his
"deferential speech, or his wink towards Kim."

"â Holy One, these be Sahibs. My medicines cured one of a flux, and I go"
into Simla to oversee his recovery. They wish to see thy pictureâ â 

"â To heal the sick is always good. This is the Wheel of Life,â  said the"
"lama, â the same I showed thee in the hut at Ziglaur when the rain"
fell.â 

â And to hear thee expound it.â 

The lamaâ s eyes lighted at the prospect of new listeners. â To expound
"the Most Excellent Way is good. Have they any knowledge of Hindi, such"
as had the Keeper of Images?â 

"â A little, maybe.â "

"Hereat, simply as a child engrossed with a new game, the lama threw"
back his head and began the full-throated invocation of the Doctor of
Divinity ere he opens the full doctrine. The strangers leaned on their
"alpenstocks and listened. Kim, squatting humbly, watched the red"
"sunlight on their faces, and the blend and parting of their long"
shadows. They wore un-English leggings and curious girt-in belts that
reminded him hazily of the pictures in a book in St Xavierâ s library
"â€˜ The Adventures of a Young Naturalist in Mexico â  was its name. Yes,"
"they looked very like the wonderful M. Sumichrast of that tale, and"
very unlike the â highly unscrupulous folkâ  of Hurree Babuâ s imagining.
"The coolies, earth-coloured and mute, crouched reverently some twenty"
"or thirty yards away, and the Babu, the slack of his thin gear snapping"
"like a marking-flag in the chill breeze, stood by with an air of happy"
proprietorship.

"â These are the men,â  Hurree whispered, as the ritual went on and the"
two whites followed the grass-blade sweeping from Hell to Heaven and
back again. â All their books are in the large  kilta  with the reddish
topâ books and reports and mapsâ and I have seen a Kingâ s letter that
either HilÃ¡s or BunÃ¡r has written. They guard it most carefully. They
have sent nothing back from HilÃ¡s or Leh. That is sure.â 

â Who is with them?â 

â Only the  beegar -coolies. They have no servants. They are so close
they cook their own food.â 

â But what am I to do?â 

â Wait and see. Only if any chance comes to me thou wilt know where to
seek for the papers.â 

"â This were better in Mahbub Aliâ s hands than a Bengaliâ s,â  said Kim"
scornfully.

â There are more ways of getting to a sweetheart than butting down a
wall.â 

â See here the Hell appointed for avarice and greed. Flanked upon the
one side by Desire and on the other by Weariness.â  The lama warmed to
"his work, and one of the strangers sketched him in the quick-fading"
light.

"â That is enough,â  the man said at last brusquely. â I cannot understand"
"him, but I want that picture. He is a better artist than I. Ask him if"
he will sell it.â 

"â He says â€˜No, sar,â â  the Babu replied. The lama, of course, would no"
more have parted with his chart to a casual wayfarer than an archbishop
would pawn the holy vessels of his cathedral. All Tibet is full of
"cheap reproductions of the Wheel; but the lama was an artist, as well"
as a wealthy Abbot in his own place.

"â Perhaps in three days, or four, or ten, if I perceive that the Sahib"
"is a Seeker and of good understanding, I may myself draw him another."
"But  this  was used for the initiation of a novice. Tell him so,"
 hakim .â 

â He wishes it nowâ for money.â 

The lama shook his head slowly and began to fold up the Wheel. The
"Russian, on his side, saw no more than an unclean old man haggling over"
"a dirty piece of paper. He drew out a handful of rupees, and snatched"
"half-jestingly at the chart, which tore in the lamaâ s grip. A low"
murmur of horror went up from the cooliesâ some of whom were Spiti men
"and, by their lights, good Buddhists. The lama rose at the insult; his"
"hand went to the heavy iron pencase that is the priestâ s weapon, and"
the Babu danced in agony.

â Now you seeâ you see why I wanted witnesses. They are highly
"unscrupulous people. Oh, sar! sar! You must  not  hit holyman!â "

â  Chela!  He has defiled the Written Word!â 

"It was too late. Before Kim could ward him off, the Russian struck the"
old man full on the face. Next instant he was rolling over and over
downhill with Kim at his throat. The blow had waked every unknown Irish
"devil in the boyâ s blood, and the sudden fall of his enemy did the"
"rest. The lama dropped to his knees, half-stunned; the coolies under"
their loads fled up the hill as fast as plainsmen run aross the level.
"They had seen sacrilege unspeakable, and it behoved them to get away"
before the Gods and devils of the hills took vengeance. The Frenchman
"ran towards the lama, fumbling at his revolver with some notion of"
making him a hostage for his companion. A shower of cutting
"stonesâ hillmen are very straight shotsâ drove him away, and a coolie"
from Ao-chung snatched the lama into the stampede. All came about as
swiftly as the sudden mountain-darkness.

"â They have taken the baggage and all the guns,â  yelled the Frenchman,"
firing blindly into the twilight.

"â All right, sar! All right! Donâ t shoot. I go to rescue,â  and Hurree,"
"pounding down the slope, cast himself bodily upon the delighted and"
"astonished Kim, who was banging his breathless foeâ s head against a"
boulder.

"â Go back to the coolies,â  whispered the Babu in his ear. â They have the"
"baggage. The papers are in the  kilta  with the red top, but look"
"through all. Take their papers, and specially the  murasla  (Kingâ s"
letter). Go! The other man comes!â 

"Kim tore uphill. A revolver-bullet rang on a rock by his side, and he"
cowered partridge-wise.

"â If you shoot,â  shouted Hurree, â they will descend and annihilate us. I"
"have rescued the gentleman, sar. This is par tic ularly dangerous.â "

"â By Jove!â  Kim was thinking hard in English. â This is damâ -tight place,"
but  I  think it is self-defence.â  He felt in his bosom for Mahbubâ s
"gift, and uncertainlyâ save for a few practice shots in the Bikanir"
"desert, he had never used the little gunâ pulled the trigger."

"â What did I say, sar!â  The Babu seemed to be in tears. â Come down here"
"and assist to resuscitate. We are all up a tree, I tell you.â "

"The shots ceased. There was a sound of stumbling feet, and Kim hurried"
"upward through the gloom, swearing like a catâ or a country-bred."

"â Did they wound thee,  chela? â  called the lama above him."

â No. And thou?â  He dived into a clump of stunted firs.

â Unhurt. Come away. We go with these folk to Shamlegh-under-the-Snow.â 

"â But not before we have done justice,â  a voice cried. â I have got the"
Sahibsâ  gunsâ all four. Let us go down.â 

â He struck the Holy Oneâ we saw it! Our cattle will be barrenâ our wives
will cease to bear! The snows will slide upon us as we go home... Atop
of all other oppression too!â 

"The little fir-clump filled with clamouring cooliesâ panic-stricken, and"
in their terror capable of anything. The man from Ao-chung clicked the
"breech-bolt of his gun impatiently, and made as to go downhill."

"â Wait a little, Holy One; they cannot go far. Wait till I return,â  said"
he.

"â It is this person who has suffered wrong,â  said the lama, his hand"
over his brow.

"â For that very reason,â  was the reply."

"â If this person overlooks it, your hands are clean. Moreover, ye"
acquire merit by obedience.â 

"â Wait, and we will all go to Shamlegh together,â  the man insisted."

"For a moment, for just so long as it needs to stuff a cartridge into a"
"breech-loader, the lama hesitated. Then he rose to his feet, and laid a"
finger on the manâ s shoulder.

â Hast thou heard?  I  say there shall be no killingâ I who was Abbot of
"Such-zen. Is it any lust of thine to be re-born as a rat, or a snake"
under the eavesâ a worm in the belly of the most mean beast? Is it thy
wish toâ â 

"The man from Ao-chung fell to his knees, for the voice boomed like a"
Tibetan devil-gong.

â Ai! ai!â  cried the Spiti men. â Do not curse usâ do not curse him. It
"was but his zeal, Holy One! ... Put down the rifle, fool!â "

â Anger on anger! Evil on evil! There will be no killing. Let the
priest-beaters go in bondage to their own acts. Just and sure is the
"Wheel, swerving not a hair! They will be born many timesâ in torment.â "
"His head drooped, and he leaned heavily on Kimâ s shoulder."

"â I have come near to great evil,  chela ,â  he whispered in that dead"
"hush under the pines. â I was tempted to loose the bullet; and truly, in"
Tibet there would have been a heavy and a slow death for them ... He
struck me across the face ... upon the flesh ...â  He slid to the
"ground, breathing heavily, and Kim could hear the over-driven heart"
bump and check.

"â Have they hurt him to the death?â  said the Ao-chung man, while the"
others stood mute.

"Kim knelt over the body in deadly fear. â Nay,â  he cried passionately,"
"â this is only a weakness.â  Then he remembered that he was a white man,"
with a white manâ s camp-fittings at his service. â Open the  kiltas! 
The Sahibs may have a medicine.â 

"â Oho! Then I know it,â  said the Ao-chung man with a laugh. â Not for"
five years was I Yankling Sahibâ s  shikarri  without knowing that
medicine. I too have tasted it. Behold!â 

He drew from his breast a bottle of cheap whiskyâ such as is sold to
explorers at Lehâ and cleverly forced a little between the lamaâ s teeth.

â So I did when Yankling Sahib twisted his foot beyond Astor. Aha! I
have already looked into their basketsâ but we will make fair division
at Shamlegh. Give him a little more. It is good medicine. Feel! His
heart goes better now. Lay his head down and rub a little on the chest.
If he had waited quietly while I accounted for the Sahibs this would
never have come. But perhaps the Sahibs may chase us here. Then it
"would not be wrong to shoot them with their own guns, heh?â "

"â One is paid, I think, already,â  said Kim between his teeth. â I kicked"
him in the groin as we went downhill. Would I had killed him!â 

"â It is well to be brave when one does not live in Rampur,â  said one"
whose hut lay within a few miles of the Rajahâ s rickety palace. â If we
"get a bad name among the Sahibs, none will employ us as  shikarris  any"
more.â 

"â Oh, but these are not Angrezi Sahibsâ not merry-minded men like Fostum"
Sahib or Yankling Sahib. They are foreignersâ they cannot speak Angrezi
as do Sahibs.â 

"Here the lama coughed and sat up, groping for the rosary."

"â There shall be no killing,â  he murmured. â Just is the Wheel! Evil on"
evilâ â 

"â Nay, Holy One. We are all here.â  The Ao-chung man timidly patted his"
"feet. â Except by thy order, no one shall be slain. Rest awhile. We will"
"make a little camp here, and later, as the moon rises, we go to"
Shamlegh-under-the-Snow.â 

"â After a blow,â  said a Spiti man sententiously, â it is best to sleep.â "

"â There is, as it were, a dizziness at the back of my neck, and a"
"pinching in it. Let me lay my head on thy lap,  chela . I am an old"
"man, but not free from passion ... We must think of the Cause of"
Things.â 

â Give him a blanket. We dare not light a fire lest the Sahibs see.â 

â Better get away to Shamlegh. None will follow us to Shamlegh.â 

This was the nervous Rampur man.

"â I have been Fostum Sahibâ s  shikarri , and I am Yankling Sahibâ s"
 shikarri . I should have been with Yankling Sahib now but for this
cursed  beegar  (the  corvÃ©e ). Let two men watch below with the guns
lest the Sahibs do more foolishness.  I  shall not leave this Holy
One.â 

"They sat down a little apart from the lama, and, after listening"
"awhile, passed round a water-pipe whose receiver was an old Day and"
Martin blacking-bottle. The glow of the red charcoal as it went from
"hand to hand lit up the narrow, blinking eyes, the high Chinese"
"cheek-bones, and the bull-throats that melted away into the dark duffle"
folds round the shoulders. They looked like kobolds from some magic
"mineâ gnomes of the hills in conclave. And while they talked, the voices"
of the snow-waters round them diminished one by one as the night-frost
choked and clogged the runnels.

â How he stood up against us!â  said a Spiti man admiring. â I remember an
"old ibex, out Ladakh-way, that Dupont Sahib missed on a shoulder-shot,"
"seven seasons back, standing up just like him. Dupont Sahib was a good"
 shikarri .â 

â Not as good as Yankling Sahib.â  The Ao-chung man took a pull at the
whisky-bottle and passed it over. â Now hear meâ unless any other man
thinks he knows more.â 

The challenge was not taken up.

â We go to Shamlegh when the moon rises. There we will fairly divide the
baggage between us. I am content with this new little rifle and all its
cartridges.â 

"â Are the bears only bad on thy holding? said a mate, sucking at the"
pipe.

"â No; but musk-pods are worth six rupees apiece now, and thy women can"
have the canvas of the tents and some of the cooking-gear. We will do
"all that at Shamlegh before dawn. Then we all go our ways, remembering"
"that we have never seen or taken service with these Sahibs, who may,"
"indeed, say that we have stolen their baggage.â "

"â That is well for thee, but what will our Rajah say?â "

"â Who is to tell him? Those Sahibs, who cannot speak our talk, or the"
"Babu, who for his own ends gave us money? Will  he  lead an army"
against us? What evidence will remain? That we do not need we shall
"throw on Shamlegh-midden, where no man has yet set foot.â "

â Who is at Shamlegh this summer?â  The place was only a grazing centre
of three or four huts.â 

"â The Woman of Shamlegh.  She  has no love for Sahibs, as we know. The"
others can be pleased with little presents; and here is enough for us
all.â  He patted the fat sides of the nearest basket.

â Butâ butâ â 

â I have said they are not true Sahibs. All their skins and heads were
bought in the bazar at Leh.  I  know the marks. I showed them to ye
last march.â 

â True. They were all bought skins and heads. Some had even the moth in
them.â 

"That was a shrewd argument, and the Ao-chung man knew his fellows."

"â If the worst comes to the worst, I shall tell Yankling Sahib, who is a"
"man of a merry mind, and he will laugh. We are not doing any wrong to"
any Sahibs whom we know.  They  are priest-beaters. They frightened us.
We fled! Who knows where we dropped the baggage? Do ye think Yankling
"Sahib will permit down-country police to wander all over the hills,"
"disturbing his game? It is a far cry from Simla to Chini, and farther"
from Shamlegh to Shamlegh-midden.â 

"â So be it, but I carry the big  kilta . The basket with the red top"
that the Sahibs pack themselves every morning.â 

"â Thus it is proved,â  said the Shamlegh man adroitly, â that they are"
"Sahibs of no account. Who ever heard of Fostum Sahib, or Yankling"
"Sahib, or even the little Peel Sahib that sits up of nights to shoot"
"serowâ I say, who, ever heard of these Sahibs coming into the hills"
"without a down-country cook, and a bearer, andâ and all manner of"
"well-paid, high-handed and oppressive folk in their tail? How can they"
make trouble? What of the  kilta? â 

"â Nothing, but that it is full of the Written Wordâ books and papers in"
"which they wrote, and strange instruments, as of worship.â "

â Shamlegh-midden will take them all.â 

â True! But how if we insult the Sahibsâ  Gods thereby! I do not like to
handle the Written Word in that fashion. And their brass idols are
beyond my comprehension. It is no plunder for simple hill-folk.â 

â The old man still sleeps. Hst! We will ask his  chela .â  The Ao-chung
"man refreshed himself, and swelled with pride of leadership."

"â We have here,â  he whispered, â a  kilta  whose nature we do not know.â "

"â But I do,â  said Kim cautiously. The lama drew breath in natural, easy"
"sleep, and Kim had been thinking of Hurreeâ s last words. As a player of"
"the Great Game, he was disposed just then to reverence the Babu. â It is"
"a  kilta  with a red top full of very wonderful things, not to be"
handled by fools.â 

"â I said it; I said it,â  cried the bearer of that burden. â Thinkest thou"
it will betray us?â 

â Not if it be given to me. I can draw out its magic. Otherwise it will
do great harm.â 

â A priest always takes his share.â  Whisky was demoralizing the Ao-chung
man.

"â It is no matter to me.â  Kim answered, with the craft of his"
"mother-country. â Share it among you, and see what comes!â "

â Not I. I was only jesting. Give the order. There is more than enough
for us all. We go our way from Shamlegh in the dawn.â 

They arranged and re-arranged their artless little plans for another
"hour, while Kim shivered with cold and pride. The humour of the"
situation tickled the Irish and the Oriental in his soul. Here were the
"emissaries of the dread Power of the North, very possibly as great in"
"their own land as Mahbub or Colonel Creighton, suddenly smitten"
"helpless. One of them, he privately knew, would be lame for a time."
They had made promises to Kings. Tonight they lay out somewhere below
"him, chartless, foodless, tentless, gunlessâ except for Hurree Babu,"
guideless. And this collapse of their Great Game (Kim wondered to whom
"they would report it), this panicky bolt into the night, had come about"
"through no craft of Hurreeâ s or contrivance of Kimâ s, but simply,"
"beautifully, and inevitably as the capture of Mahbubâ s  faquir -friends"
by the zealous young policeman at Umballa.

"â They are thereâ with nothing; and, by Jove, it is cold! I am here with"
"all their things. Oh, they will be angry! I am sorry for Hurree Babu.â "

"Kim might have saved his pity, for though at that moment the Bengali"
"suffered acutely in the flesh, his soul was puffed and lofty. A mile"
"down the hill, on the edge of the pine-forest, two half-frozen menâ one"
powerfully sick at intervalsâ were varying mutual recriminations with
"the most poignant abuse of the Babu, who seemed distraught with terror."
They demanded a plan of action. He explained that they were very lucky
"to be alive; that their coolies, if not then stalking them, had passed"
"beyond recall; that the Rajah, his master, was ninety miles away, and,"
"so far from lending them money and a retinue for the Simla journey,"
would surely cast them into prison if he heard that they had hit a
priest. He enlarged on this sin and its consequences till they bade him
"change the subject. Their one hope, said he, was unostentatious flight"
"from village to village till they reached civilization; and, for the"
"hundredth time dissolved in tears, he demanded of the high stars why"
the Sahibs â had beaten holy manâ .

Ten steps would have taken Hurree into the creaking gloom utterly
"beyond their reachâ to the shelter and food of the nearest village,"
where glib-tongued doctors were scarce. But he preferred to endure
"cold, belly-pinch, bad words, and occasional blows in the company of"
"his honoured employers. Crouched against a tree-trunk, he sniffed"
dolefully.

"â And have you thought,â  said the uninjured man hotly, â what sort of"
spectacle we shall present wandering through these hills among these
aborigines?â 

"Hurree Babu had thought of little else for some hours, but the remark"
was not to his address.

"â We cannot wander! I can hardly walk,â  groaned Kimâ s victim."

"â Perhaps the holy man will be merciful in loving-kindness, sar,"
otherwiseâ â 

â I promise myself a peculiar pleasure in emptying my revolver into that
"young bonze when next we meet,â  was the unchristian answer."

â Revolvers! Vengeance! Bonzes!â  Hurree crouched lower. The war was
breaking out afresh. â Have you no consideration for our loss? The
baggage! The baggage!â  He could hear the speaker literally dancing on
the grass. â Everything we bore! Everything we have secured! Our gains!
Eight monthsâ  work! Do you know what that means? â€˜Decidedly it is we
"who can deal with Orientals!â  Oh, you have done well.â "

"They fell to it in several tongues, and Hurree smiled. Kim was with the"
" kiltas , and in the  kiltas  lay eight months of good diplomacy. There"
"was no means of communicating with the boy, but he could be trusted."
"For the rest, Hurree could so stage-manage the journey through the"
"hills that HilÃ¡s, BunÃ¡r, and four hundred miles of hill-roads should"
tell the tale for a generation. Men who cannot control their own
"coolies are little respected in the Hills, and the hillman has a very"
keen sense of humour.

"â If I had done it myself,â  thought Hurree, â it would not have been"
"better; and, by Jove, now I think of it, of course I arranged it"
myself. How quick I have been! Just when I ran downhill I thought it!
"Thee outrage was accidental, but onlee me could have worked itâ ahâ for"
all it was damâ -well worth. Consider the moral effect upon these
ignorant peoples! No treatiesâ no papersâ no written documents at allâ and
 me  to interpret for them. How I shall laugh with the Colonel! I wish
I had their papers also: but you cannot occupy two places in space
simultaneously. Thatt is axiomatic.â 




CHAPTER XIV


My brother kneels (so saith Kabir)
"To stone and brass in heathen wise,"
But in my brotherâ s voice I hear
My own unanswered agonies.
His God is as his Fates assignâ 
His prayer is all the worldâ sâ and mine.

KABIR.

"At moonrise the cautious coolies got under way. The lama, refreshed by"
"his sleep and the spirit, needed no more than Kimâ s shoulder to bear"
"him alongâ a silent, swift-striding man. They held the shale-sprinkled"
"grass for an hour, swept round the shoulder of an immortal cliff, and"
climbed into a new country entirely blocked off from all sight of Chini
valley. A huge pasture-ground ran up fan-shaped to the living snow. At
"its base was perhaps half an acre of flat land, on which stood a few"
"soil and timber huts. Behind themâ for, hill-fashion, they were perched"
on the edge of all thingsâ the ground fell sheer two thousand feet to
"Shamlegh-midden, where never yet man has set foot."

The men made no motion to divide the plunder till they had seen the
"lama bedded down in the best room of the place, with Kim shampooing his"
"feet, Mohammedan-fashion."

"â We will send food,â  said the Ao-chung man, â and the red-topped"
" kilta . By dawn there will be none to give evidence, one way or the"
other. If anything is not needed in the  kilta â see here!â 

He pointed through the windowâ opening into space that was filled with
moonlight reflected from the snowâ and threw out an empty whisky-bottle.

"â No need to listen for the fall. This is the worldâ s end,â  he said, and"
"went out. The lama looked forth, a hand on either sill, with eyes that"
shone like yellow opals. From the enormous pit before him white peaks
lifted themselves yearning to the moonlight. The rest was as the
darkness of interstellar space.

"â These,â  he said slowly, â are indeed my Hills. Thus should a man abide,"
"perched above the world, separated from delights, considering vast"
matters.â 

"â Yes; if he has a  chela  to prepare tea for him, and to fold a blanket"
"for his head, and to chase out calving cows.â "

"A smoky lamp burned in a niche, but the full moonlight beat it down;"
"and by the mixed light, stooping above the food-bag and cups, Kim moved"
like a tall ghost.

"â Ai! But now I have let the blood cool, my head still beats and drums,"
and there is a cord round the back of my neck.â 

â No wonder. It was a strong blow. May he who dealt itâ â 

â But for my own passions there would have been no evil.â 

â What evil? Thou hast saved the Sahibs from the death they deserved a
hundred times.â 

"â The lesson is not well learnt,  chela .â  The lama came to rest on a"
"folded blanket, as Kim went forward with his evening routine. â The blow"
was but a shadow upon a shadow. Evil in itselfâ my legs weary apace
"these latter days!â it met evil in me: anger, rage, and a lust to return"
"evil. These wrought in my blood, woke tumult in my stomach, and dazzled"
"my ears.â  Here he drank scalding black-tea ceremonially, taking the hot"
"cup from Kimâ s hand. â Had I been passionless, the evil blow would have"
"done only bodily evilâ a scar, or a bruiseâ which is illusion. But my"
"mind was  not  abstracted, for rushed in straightway a lust to let the"
"Spiti men kill. In fighting that lust, my soul was torn and wrenched"
beyond a thousand blows. Not till I had repeated the Blessingsâ  (he
meant the Buddhist Beatitudes) â did I achieve calm. But the evil
planted in me by that momentâ s carelessness works out to its end. Just
"is the Wheel, swerving not a hair! Learn the lesson,  chela .â "

"â It is too high for me,â  Kim muttered. â I am still all shaken. I am"
glad I hurt the man.â 

"â I felt that, sleeping upon thy knees, in the wood below. It disquieted"
me in my dreamsâ the evil in thy soul working through to mine. Yet on
the other handâ â he loosed his rosaryâ â I have acquired merit by saving
two livesâ the lives of those that wronged me. Now I must see into the
Cause of Things. The boat of my soul staggers.â 

"â Sleep, and be strong. That is wisest.â "

â I meditate. There is a need greater than thou knowest.â 

"Till the dawn, hour after hour, as the moonlight paled on the high"
"peaks, and that which had been belted blackness on the sides of the far"
"hills showed as tender green forest, the lama stared fixedly at the"
"wall. From time to time he groaned. Outside the barred door, where"
"discomfited kine came to ask for their old stable, Shamlegh and the"
coolies gave itself up to plunder and riotous living. The Ao-chung man
"was their leader, and once they had opened the Sahibsâ  tinned foods and"
found that they were very good they dared not turn back. Shamlegh
kitchen-midden took the dunnage.

"When Kim, after a night of bad dreams, stole forth to brush his teeth"
"in the morning chill, a fair-coloured woman with turquoise-studded"
headgear drew him aside.

â The others have gone. They left thee this  kilta  as the promise was.
"I do not love Sahibs, but thou wilt make us a charm in return for it."
We do not wish little Shamlegh to get a bad name on account of
theâ accident. I am the Woman of Shamlegh.â  She looked him over with
"bold, bright eyes, unlike the usual furtive glance of hillwomen."

â Assuredly. But it must be done in secret.â 

She raised the heavy  kilta  like a toy and slung it into her own hut.

"â Out and bar the door! Let none come near till it is finished,â  said"
Kim.

â But afterwardsâ we may talk?â 

"Kim tilted the  kilta  on the floorâ a cascade of Survey-instruments,"
"books, diaries, letters, maps, and queerly scented native"
correspondence. At the very bottom was an embroidered bag covering a
"sealed, gilded, and illuminated document such as one King sends to"
"another. Kim caught his breath with delight, and reviewed the situation"
from a Sahibâ s point of view.

"â The books I do not want. Besides, they are logarithmsâ Survey, I"
"suppose.â  He laid them aside. â The letters I do not understand, but"
Colonel Creighton will. They must all be kept. The mapsâ they draw
better maps than meâ of course. All the native lettersâ oho!â and
particularly the  murasla .â  He sniffed the embroidered bag. â That must
"be from HilÃ¡s or BunÃ¡r, and Hurree Babu spoke truth. By Jove! It is a"
fine haul. I wish Hurree could know ... The rest must go out of the
window.â  He fingered a superb prismatic compass and the shiny top of a
"theodolite. But after all, a Sahib cannot very well steal, and the"
things might be inconvenient evidence later. He sorted out every scrap
"of manuscript, every map, and the native letters. They made one softish"
"slab. The three locked ferril-backed books, with five worn"
"pocket-books, he put aside."

â The letters and the  murasla  I must carry inside my coat and under my
"belt, and the hand-written books I must put into the food-bag. It will"
"be very heavy. No. I do not think there is anything more. If there is,"
"the coolies have thrown it down the  khud , so  thatt  is all right."
"Now you go too.â  He repacked the  kilta  with all he meant to lose, and"
"hove it up on to the windowsill. A thousand feet below lay a long,"
"lazy, round-shouldered bank of mist, as yet untouched by the morning"
sun. A thousand feet below that was a hundred-year-old pine-forest. He
could see the green tops looking like a bed of moss when a wind-eddy
thinned the cloud.

â No! I donâ t think any one will go after  you! â 

The wheeling basket vomited its contents as it dropped. The theodolite
"hit a jutting cliff-ledge and exploded like a shell; the books,"
"inkstands, paint-boxes, compasses, and rulers showed for a few seconds"
"like a swarm of bees. Then they vanished; and, though Kim, hanging half"
"out of the window, strained his young ears, never a sound came up from"
the gulf.

"â Five hundredâ a thousand rupees could not buy them,â  he thought"
"sorrowfully. â It was verree wasteful, but I have all their other"
stuffâ everything they didâ I hope. Now how the deuce am I to tell Hurree
"Babu, and  whatt  the deuce am I to do? And my old man is sick. I must"
tie up the letters in oilskin. That is something to do firstâ else they
will get all sweated ... And I am all alone!â  He bound them into a neat
"packet, swedging down the stiff, sticky oilskin at the comers, for his"
roving life had made him as methodical as an old hunter in matters of
the road. Then with double care he packed away the books at the bottom
of the food-bag.

The woman rapped at the door.

"â But thou hast made no charm,â  she said, looking about."

â There is no need.â  Kim had completely overlooked the necessity for a
little patter-talk. The woman laughed at his confusion irreverently.

â Noneâ for thee. Thou canst cast a spell by the mere winking of an eye.
But think of us poor people when thou art gone. They were all too drunk
last night to hear a woman. Thou art not drunk?â 

"â I am a priest.â  Kim had recovered himself, and, the woman being aught"
"but unlovely, thought best to stand on his office."

â I warned them that the Sahibs will be angry and will make an
inquisition and a report to the Rajah. There is also the Babu with
them. Clerks have long tongues.â 

"â Is that all thy trouble?â  The plan rose fully formed in Kimâ s mind,"
and he smiled ravishingly.

"â Not all,â  quoth the woman, putting out a hard brown hand all covered"
with turquoises set in silver.

"â I can finish that in a breath,â  he went on quickly. â The Babu is the"
very  hakim  (thou hast heard of him?) who was wandering among the
hills by Ziglaur. I know him.â 

â He will tell for the sake of a reward. Sahibs cannot distinguish one
"hillman from another, but Babus have eyes for menâ and women.â "

â Carry a word to him from me.â 

â There is nothing I would not do for thee.â 

"He accepted the compliment calmly, as men must in lands where women"
"make the love, tore a leaf from a note-book, and with a patent"
indelible pencil wrote in gross Shikastâ the script that bad little boys
use when they write dirt on walls: â  I have everything that they have
"written: their pictures of the country, and many letters. Especially"
the murasla. Tell me what to do. I am at Shamlegh-under-the-Snow. The
old man is sick. â 

â Take this to him. It will altogether shut his mouth. He cannot have
gone far.â 

â Indeed no. They are still in the forest across the spur. Our children
"went to watch them when the light came, and have cried the news as they"
moved.â 

Kim looked his astonishment; but from the edge of the sheep-pasture
"floated a shrill, kite-like trill. A child tending cattle had picked it"
up from a brother or sister on the far side of the slope that commanded
Chini valley.

â My husbands are also out there gathering wood.â  She drew a handful of
"walnuts from her bosom, split one neatly, and began to eat. Kim"
affected blank ignorance.

"â Dost thou not know the meaning of the walnutâ priest?â  she said coyly,"
and handed him the half-shells.

â Well thought of.â  He slipped the piece of paper between them quickly.
â Hast thou a little wax to close them on this letter?â 

"The woman sighed aloud, and Kim relented."

â There is no payment till service has been rendered. Carry this to the
"Babu, and say it was sent by the Son of the Charm.â "

â Ai! Truly! Truly! By a magicianâ who is like a Sahib.â 

"â Nay, a Son of the Charm: and ask if there be any answer.â "

â But if he offer a rudeness? Iâ I am afraid.â 

"Kim laughed. â He is, I have no doubt, very tired and very hungry. The"
"Hills make cold bedfellows. Hai, myâ â it was on the tip of his tongue to"
"say Mother, but he turned it to Sisterâ â thou art a wise and witty"
woman. By this time all the villages know what has befallen the
Sahibsâ eh?â 

"â True. News was at Ziglaur by midnight, and by tomorrow should be at"
Kotgarh. The villages are both afraid and angry.â 

"â No need. Tell the villages to feed the Sahibs and pass them on, in"
peace. We must get them quietly away from our valleys. To steal is one
"thingâ to kill another. The Babu will understand, and there will be no"
after-complaints. Be swift. I must tend my master when he wakes.â 

â So be it. After serviceâ thou hast said?â comes the reward. I am the
"Woman of Shamlegh, and I hold from the Rajah. I am no common bearer of"
"babes. Shamlegh is thine: hoof and horn and hide, milk and butter. Take"
or leave.â 

"She turned resolutely uphill, her silver necklaces clicking on her"
"broad breast, to meet the morning sun fifteen hundred feet above them."
This time Kim thought in the vernacular as he waxed down the oilskin
edges of the packets.

â How can a man follow the Way or the Great Game when he is soâ always
pestered by women? There was that girl at Akrola of the Ford; and there
was the scullionâ s wife behind the dovecotâ not counting the othersâ and
"now comes this one! When I was a child it was well enough, but now I am"
"a man and they will not regard me as a man. Walnuts, indeed! Ho! ho! It"
is almonds in the Plains!â 

"He went out to levy on the villageâ not with a begging-bowl, which might"
"do for down-country, but in the manner of a prince. Shamleghâ s summer"
population is only three familiesâ four women and eight or nine men.
"They were all full of tinned meats and mixed drinks, from ammoniated"
"quinine to white vodka, for they had taken their full share in the"
overnight loot. The neat Continental tents had been cut up and shared
"long ago, and there were patent aluminium saucepans abroad."

But they considered the lamaâ s presence a perfect safeguard against all
"consequences, and impenitently brought Kim of their bestâ even to a"
drink of  chang â the barley-beer that comes from Ladakh-way. Then they
"thawed out in the sun, and sat with their legs hanging over infinite"
"abysses, chattering, laughing, and smoking. They judged India and its"
Government solely from their experience of wandering Sahibs who had
employed them or their friends as  shikarris . Kim heard tales of shots
"missed upon ibex, serow, or markhor, by Sahibs twenty years in their"
gravesâ every detail lighted from behind like twigs on tree-tops seen
"against lightning. They told him of their little diseases, and, more"
"important, the diseases of their tiny, sure-footed cattle; of trips as"
"far as Kotgarh, where the strange missionaries live, and beyond even to"
"marvellous Simla, where the streets are paved with silver, and anyone,"
"look you, can get service with the Sahibs, who ride about in"
"two-wheeled carts and spend money with a spade. Presently, grave and"
"aloof, walking very heavily, the lama joined himself to the chatter"
"under the eaves, and they gave him great room. The thin air refreshed"
"him, and he sat on the edge of precipices with the best of them, and,"
"when talk languished, flung pebbles into the void. Thirty miles away,"
"as the eagle flies, lay the next range, seamed and channelled and"
"pitted with little patches of brushâ forests, each a dayâ s dark march."
"Behind the village, Shamlegh hill itself cut off all view to southward."
It was like sitting in a swallowâ s nest under the eaves of the roof of
the world.

"From time to time the lama stretched out his hand, and with a little"
low-voiced prompting would point out the road to Spiti and north across
the Parungla.

"â Beyond, where the hills lie thickest, lies De-châ enâ  (he meant"
"Han-lÃ©â ), â the great Monastery. sâ Tag-stan-ras-châ en built it, and of"
him there runs this tale.â  Whereupon he told it: a fantastic piled
narrative of bewitchment and miracles that set Shamlegh a-gasping.
"Turning west a little, he steered for the green hills of Kulu, and"
"sought Kailung under the glaciers. â For thither came I in the old, old"
"days. From Leh I came, over the Baralachi.â "

"â Yes, yes; we know it,â  said the far-faring people of Shamlegh."

â And I slept two nights with the priests of Kailung. These are the
Hills of my delight! Shadows blessed above all other shadows! There my
eyes opened on this world; there my eyes were opened to this world;
there I found Enlightenment; and there I girt my loins for my Search.
"Out of the Hills I cameâ the high Hills and the strong winds. Oh, just"
"is the Wheel!â  He blessed them in detailâ the great glaciers, the naked"
"rocks, the piled moraines and tumbled shale; dry upland, hidden"
"salt-lake, age-old timber and fruitful water-shot valley one after the"
"other, as a dying man blesses his folk; and Kim marvelled at his"
passion.

"â Yesâ yes. There is no place like our Hills,â  said the people of"
Shamlegh. And they fell to wondering how a man could live in the hot
"terrible Plains where the cattle run as big as elephants, unfit to"
"plough on a hillside; where village touches village, they had heard,"
"for a hundred miles; where folk went about stealing in gangs, and what"
the robbers spared the Police carried utterly away.

"So the still forenoon wore through, and at the end of it Kimâ s"
messenger dropped from the steep pasture as unbreathed as when she had
set out.

"â I sent a word to the  hakim ,â  Kim explained, while she made"
reverence.

"â He joined himself to the idolaters? Nay, I remember he did a healing"
"upon one of them. He has acquired merit, though the healed employed his"
strength for evil. Just is the Wheel! What of the  hakim? â 

â I feared that thou hadst been bruised andâ and I knew he was wise.â  Kim
took the waxed walnut-shell and read in English on the back of his
note:  Your favour received. Cannot get away from present company at
"present, but shall take them into Simla. After which, hope to rejoin"
you. Inexpedient to follow angry gentlemen. Return by same road you
"came, and will overtake. Highly gratified about correspondence due to"
"my forethought.  â He says, Holy One, that he will escape from the"
"idolaters, and will return to us. Shall we wait awhile at Shamlegh,"
then?â 

The lama looked long and lovingly upon the hills and shook his head.

"â That may not be,  chela . From my bones outward I do desire it, but it"
is forbidden. I have seen the Cause of Things.â 

â Why? When the Hills give thee back thy strength day by day? Remember
we were weak and fainting down below there in the Doon.â 

â I became strong to do evil and to forget. A brawler and a swashbuckler
upon the hillsides was I.â  Kim bit back a smile. â Just and perfect is
"the Wheel, swerving not a hair. When I was a manâ a long time agoâ I did"
"pilgrimage to Guru Châ wan among the poplarsâ  (he pointed Bhotanwards),"
â where they keep the Sacred Horse.â 

"â Quiet, be quiet!â  said Shamlegh, all arow. â He speaks of"
"Jam-lin-nin-kâ or, the Horse That Can Go Round The World In a Day.â "

"â I speak to my  chela  only,â  said the lama, in gentle reproof, and"
they scattered like frost on south eaves of a morning. â I did not seek
"truth in those days, but the talk of doctrine. All illusion! I drank"
the beer and ate the bread of Guru Châ wan. Next day one said: â€˜We go
out to fight Sangor Gutok down the valley to discoverâ  (mark again how
Lust is tied to Anger!) â€˜which Abbot shall bear rule in the valley and
"take the profit of the prayers they print at Sangor Gutok.â  I went, and"
we fought a day.â 

"â But how, Holy One?â "

"â With our long pencases as I could have shown ... I say, we fought"
"under the poplars, both Abbots and all the monks, and one laid open my"
forehead to the bone. See!â  He tilted back his cap and showed a
puckered silvery scar. â Just and perfect is the Wheel! Yesterday the
"scar itched, and after fifty years I recalled how it was dealt and the"
face of him who dealt it; dwelling a little in illusion. Followed that
which thou didst seeâ strife and stupidity. Just is the Wheel! The
idolaterâ s blow fell upon the scar. Then I was shaken in my soul: my
"soul was darkened, and the boat of my soul rocked upon the waters of"
illusion. Not till I came to Shamlegh could I meditate upon the Cause
"of Things, or trace the running grass-roots of Evil. I strove all the"
long night.â 

"â But, Holy One, thou art innocent of all evil. May I be thy sacrifice!â "

"Kim was genuinely distressed at the old manâ s sorrow, and Mahbub Aliâ s"
phrase slipped out unawares.

"â In the dawn,â  the lama went on more gravely, ready rosary clicking"
"between the slow sentences, â came enlightenment. It is here ... I am an"
"old man ... hill-bred, hill-fed, never to sit down among my Hills."
"Three years I travelled through Hind, butâ can earth be stronger than"
Mother Earth? My stupid body yearned to the Hills and the snows of the
"Hills, from below there. I said, and it is true, my Search is sure. So,"
"at the Kulu womanâ s house I turned hillward, over-persuaded by myself."
There is no blame to the  hakim . Heâ following Desireâ foretold that the
"Hills would make me strong. They strengthened me to do evil, to forget"
my Search. I delighted in life and the lust of life. I desired strong
slopes to climb. I cast about to find them. I measured the strength of
"my body, which is evil, against the high Hills, I made a mock of thee"
when thy breath came short under Jamnotri. I jested when thou wouldst
not face the snow of the pass.â 

â But what harm? I  was  afraid. It was just. I am not a hillman; and I
loved thee for thy new strength.â 

â More than once I rememberâ â he rested his cheek dolefully on his
handâ â I sought thy praise and the  hakimâ s  for the mere strength of my
legs. Thus evil followed evil till the cup was full. Just is the Wheel!
All Hind for three years did me all honour. From the Fountain of Wisdom
in the Wonder House toâ â he smiledâ â a little child playing by a big
gunâ the world prepared my road. And why?â 

â Because we loved thee. It is only the fever of the blow. I myself am
still sick and shaken.â 

â No! It was because I was upon the Wayâ tuned as are  si-nen  (cymbals)
to the purpose of the Law. I departed from that ordinance. The tune was
"broken: followed the punishment. In my own Hills, on the edge of my own"
"country, in the very place of my evil desire, comes the buffetâ here!â "
(He touched his brow.) â As a novice is beaten when he misplaces the
"cups, so am I beaten, who was Abbot of Such-zen. No word, look you, but"
"a blow,  chela .â "

"â But the Sahibs did not know thee, Holy One?â "

â We were well matched. Ignorance and Lust met Ignorance and Lust upon
"the road, and they begat Anger. The blow was a sign to me, who am no"
"better than a strayed yak, that my place is not here. Who can read the"
"Cause of an act is halfway to Freedom! â€˜Back to the path,â  says the"
Blow. â€˜The Hills are not for thee. Thou canst not choose Freedom and go
in bondage to the delight of life.â â 

â Would we had never met that cursed Russian!â 

â Our Lord Himself cannot make the Wheel swing backward. And for my
merit that I had acquired I gain yet another sign.â  He put his hand in
"his bosom, and drew forth the Wheel of Life. â Look! I considered this"
after I had meditated. There remains untorn by the idolater no more
than the breadth of my fingernail.â 

â I see.â 

"â So much, then, is the span of my life in this body. I have served the"
Wheel all my days. Now the Wheel serves me. But for the merit I have
"acquired in guiding thee upon the Way, there would have been added to"
"me yet another life ere I had found my River. Is it plain,  chela? â "

Kim stared at the brutally disfigured chart. From left to right
diagonally the rent ranâ from the Eleventh House where Desire gives
birth to the Child (as it is drawn by Tibetans)â across the human and
"animal worlds, to the Fifth Houseâ the empty House of the Senses. The"
logic was unanswerable.

â Before our Lord won Enlightenmentâ â the lama folded all away with
"reverenceâ â He was tempted. I too have been tempted, but it is finished."
"The Arrow fell in the Plainsâ not in the Hills. Therefore, what make we"
here?â 

â Shall we at least wait for the  hakim? â 

â I know how long I shall live in this body. What can a  hakim  do?â 

â But thou art all sick and shaken. Thou canst not walk.â 

â How can I be sick if I see Freedom?â  He rose unsteadily to his feet.

"â Then I must get food from the village. Oh, the weary Road!â  Kim felt"
that he too needed rest.

â That is lawful. Let us eat and go. The Arrow fell in the Plains ...
"but I yielded to Desire. Make ready,  chela .â "

Kim turned to the woman with the turquoise headgear who had been idly
pitching pebbles over the cliff. She smiled very kindly.

â I found him like a strayed buffalo in a cornfieldâ the Babu; snorting
and sneezing with cold. He was so hungry that he forgot his dignity and
gave me sweet words. The Sahibs have nothing.â  She flung out an empty
palm. â One is very sick about the stomach. Thy work?â 

"Kim nodded, with a bright eye."

â I spoke to the Bengali firstâ and to the people of a near-by village
after. The Sahibs will be given food as they need itâ nor will the
people ask money. The plunder is already distributed. The Babu makes
lying speeches to the Sahibs. Why does he not leave them?â 

â Out of the greatness of his heart.â 

â Was never a Bengali yet had one bigger than a dried walnut. But it is
no matter ... Now as to walnuts. After service comes reward. I have
said the village is thine.â 

"â It is my loss,â  Kim began. â Even now I had planned desirable things in"
my heart whichâ â there is no need to go through the compliments proper
"to these occasions. He sighed deeply ... â But my master, led by a"
visionâ â 

â Huh! What can old eyes see except a full begging-bowl?â 

â â turns from this village to the Plains again.â 

â Bid him stay.â 

"Kim shook his head. â I know my Holy One, and his rage if he be"
"crossed,â  he replied impressively. â His curses shake the Hills.â "

â Pity they did not save him from a broken head! I heard that thou wast
the tiger-hearted one who smote the Sahib. Let him dream a little
longer. Stay!â 

"â Hillwoman,â  said Kim, with austerity that could not harden the"
"outlines of his young oval face, â these matters are too high for thee.â "

â The Gods be good to us! Since when have men and women been other than
men and women?â 

â A priest is a priest. He says he will go upon this hour. I am his
" chela , and I go with him. We need food for the Road. He is an"
"honoured guest in all the villages, butâ â he broke into a pure boyâ s"
grinâ â the food here is good. Give me some.â 

â What if I do not give it thee? I am the woman of this village.â 

"â Then I curse theeâ a littleâ not greatly, but enough to remember.â  He"
could not help smiling.

â Thou hast cursed me already by the down-dropped eyelash and the
uplifted chin. Curses? What should I care for mere words?â  She clenched
"her hands upon her bosom ... â But I would not have thee to go in anger,"
"thinking hardly of meâ a gatherer of cow-dung and grass at Shamlegh, but"
still a woman of substance.â 

"â I think nothing,â  said Kim, â but that I am grieved to go, for I am"
very weary; and that we need food. Here is the bag.â 

"The woman snatched it angrily. â I was foolish,â  said she. â Who is thy"
woman in the Plains? Fair or black? I was fair once. Laughest thou?
"Once, long ago, if thou canst believe, a Sahib looked on me with"
"favour. Once, long ago, I wore European clothes at the Mission-house"
"yonder.â  She pointed towards Kotgarh. â Once, long ago. I was"
 Ker-lis-ti-an  and spoke Englishâ as the Sahibs speak it. Yes. My Sahib
"said he would return and wed meâ yes, wed me. He went awayâ I had nursed"
him when he was sickâ but he never returned. Then I saw that the Gods of
"the Kerlistians lied, and I went back to my own people ... I have never"
"set eyes on a Sahib since. (Do not laugh at me. The fit is past, little"
priestling.) Thy face and thy walk and thy fashion of speech put me in
"mind of my Sahib, though thou art only a wandering mendicant to whom I"
give a dole. Curse me? Thou canst neither curse nor bless!â  She set her
hands on her hips and laughed bitterly. â Thy Gods are lies; thy works
are lies; thy words are lies. There are no Gods under all the Heavens.
"I know it ... But for awhile I thought it was my Sahib come back, and"
"he was my God. Yes, once I made music on a  pianno  in the"
Mission-house at Kotgarh. Now I give alms to priests who are
" heatthen .â  She wound up with the English word, and tied the mouth of"
the brimming bag.

"â I wait for thee,  chela ,â  said the lama, leaning against the"
door-post.

The woman swept the tall figure with her eyes. â He walk! He cannot
cover half a mile. Whither would old bones go?â 

"At this Kim, already perplexed by the lamaâ s collapse and foreseeing"
"the weight of the bag, fairly lost his temper."

"â What is it to thee, woman of ill-omen, where he goes?â "

"â Nothingâ but something to thee, priest with a Sahibâ s face. Wilt thou"
carry him on thy shoulders?â 

â I go to the Plains. None must hinder my return. I have wrestled with
"my soul till I am strengthless. The stupid body is spent, and we are"
far from the Plains.â 

"â Behold!â  she said simply, and drew aside to let Kim see his own utter"
helplessness. â Curse me. Maybe it will give him strength. Make a charm!
Call on thy great God. Thou art a priest.â  She turned away.

"The lama had squatted limply, still holding by the door-post. One"
cannot strike down an old man that he recovers again like a boy in the
"night. Weakness bowed him to the earth, but his eyes that hung on Kim"
were alive and imploring.

"â It is all well,â  said Kim. â It is the thin air that weakens thee. In a"
little while we go! It is the mountain-sickness. I too am a little sick
"at stomach,â â and he knelt and comforted with such poor words as came"
"first to his lips. Then the woman returned, more erect than ever."

"â Thy Gods useless, heh? Try mine. I am the Woman of Shamlegh.â  She"
"hailed hoarsely, and there came out of a cow-pen her two husbands and"
"three others with a  dooli , the rude native litter of the Hills, that"
they use for carrying the sick and for visits of state. â These
cattleâ â she did not condescend to look at themâ â are thine for so long
as thou shalt need.â 

"â But we will not go Simla-way. We will not go near the Sahibs,â  cried"
the first husband.

"â They will not run away as the others did, nor will they steal baggage."
"Two I know for weaklings. Stand to the rear-pole, Sonoo and Taree.â "
"They obeyed swiftly. â Lower now, and lift in that holy man. I will see"
to the village and your virtuous wives till ye return.â 

â When will that be?â 

"â Ask the priests. Do not pester me. Lay the food-bag at the foot, it"
balances better so.â 

"â Oh, Holy One, thy Hills are kinder than our Plains!â  cried Kim,"
"relieved, as the lama tottered to the litter. â It is a very kingâ s"
bedâ a place of honour and ease. And we owe it toâ â 

â A woman of ill-omen. I need thy blessings as much as I do thy curses.
It is  my  order and none of thine. Lift and away! Here! Hast thou
money for the road?â 

"She beckoned Kim to her hut, and stooped above a battered English"
cash-box under her cot.

"â I do not need anything,â  said Kim, angered where he should have been"
grateful. â I am already rudely loaded with favours.â 

She looked up with a curious smile and laid a hand on his shoulder. â At
"least, thank me. I am foul-faced and a hillwoman, but, as thy talk"
"goes, I have acquired merit. Shall I show thee how the Sahibs render"
thanks?â  and her hard eyes softened.

"â I am but a wandering priest,â  said Kim, his eyes lighting in answer."
â Thou needest neither my blessings nor my curses.â 

â Nay. But for one little momentâ thou canst overtake the  dooli  in ten
"stridesâ  if  thou wast a Sahib, shall I show thee what thou wouldst"
do?â 

"â How if I guess, though?â  said Kim, and putting his arm round her"
"waist, he kissed her on the cheek, adding in English: â Thank you verree"
"much, my dear.â "

"Kissing is practically unknown among Asiatics, which may have been the"
reason that she leaned back with wide-open eyes and a face of panic.

"â Next time,â  Kim went on, â you must not be so sure of your heatthen"
priests. Now I say good-bye.â  He held out his hand English-fashion. She
"took it mechanically. â Good-bye, my dear.â "

"â Good-bye, andâ andâ â she was remembering her English words one by"
"oneâ â you will come back again? Good-bye, andâ thee God bless you.â "

"Half an hour later, as the creaking litter jolted up the hill path that"
"leads south-easterly from Shamlegh, Kim saw a tiny figure at the hut"
door waving a white rag.

"â She has acquired merit beyond all others,â  said the lama. â For to set"
a man upon the way to Freedom is half as great as though she had
herself found it.â 

"â Umm,â  said Kim thoughtfully, considering the past. â It may be that I"
have acquired merit also ... At least she did not treat me like a
"child.â  He hitched the front of his robe, where lay the slab of"
"documents and maps, re-stowed the precious food-bag at the lamaâ s feet,"
"laid his hand on the litterâ s edge, and buckled down to the slow pace"
of the grunting husbands.

"â These also acquire merit,â  said the lama after three miles."

"â More than that, they shall be paid in silver,â  quoth Kim. The Woman of"
"Shamlegh had given it to him; and it was only fair, he argued, that her"
men should earn it back again.

To the Triple Crown Iâ d not bow downâ 
But this is a different thing!

The Dreamer whose dream came true!

 The Siege of the Fairies. 

"Two hundred miles north of Chini, on the blue shale of Ladakh, lies"
"Yankling Sahib, the merry-minded man, spy-glassing wrathfully across"
the ridges for some sign of his pet trackerâ a man from Ao-chung. But
"that renegade, with a new Mannlicher rifle and two hundred cartridges,"
"is elsewhere, shooting musk-deer for the market, and Yankling Sahib"
will learn next season how very ill he has been.

Up the valleys of Bushahrâ the far-beholding eagles of the Himalayas
"swerve at his new blue-and-white gored umbrellaâ hurries a Bengali, once"
"fat and well-looking, now lean and weather-worn. He has received the"
"thanks of two foreigners of distinction, piloted not unskilfully to"
"Mashobra tunnel, which leads to the great and gay capital of India. It"
"was not his fault that, blanketed by wet mists, he conveyed them past"
the telegraph-station and European colony of Kotgarh. It was not his
"fault, but that of the Gods, of whom he discoursed so engagingly, that"
"he led them into the borders of Nahan, where the Rahah of that State"
mistook them for deserting British soldiery. Hurree Babu explained the
"greatness and glory, in their own country, of his companions, till the"
drowsy kinglet smiled. He explained it to everyone who askedâ many
"timesâ aloudâ variously. He begged food, arranged accommodation, proved a"
skilful leech for an injury of the groinâ such a blow as one may receive
rolling down a rock-covered hillside in the darkâ and in all things
indispensable. The reason of his friendliness did him credit. With
"millions of fellow-serfs, he had learned to look upon Russia as the"
great deliverer from the North. He was a fearful man. He had been
afraid that he could not save his illustrious employers from the anger
of an excited peasantry. He himself would just as lief hit a holy man
"as not, but ... He was deeply grateful and sincerely rejoiced that he"
had done his â little possibleâ  towards bringing their venture
"toâ barring the lost baggageâ a successful issue, he had forgotten the"
blows; denied that any blows had been dealt that unseemly first night
"under the pines. He asked neither pension nor retaining fee, but, if"
"they deemed him worthy, would they write him a testimonial? It might be"
"useful to him later, if others, their friends, came over the Passes. He"
"begged them to remember him in their future greatnesses, for he â opined"
"subtlyâ  that he, even he, Mohendro Lal Dutt, MA of Calcutta, had â done"
the State some serviceâ .

"They gave him a certificate praising his courtesy, helpfulness, and"
unerring skill as a guide. He put it in his waist-belt and sobbed with
emotion; they had endured so many dangers together. He led them at high
"noon along crowded Simla Mall to the Alliance Bank of Simla, where they"
wished to establish their identity. Thence he vanished like a
dawn-cloud on Jakko.

"Behold him, too fine-drawn to sweat, too pressed to vaunt the drugs in"
"his little brass-bound box, ascending Shamlegh slope, a just man made"
"perfect. Watch him, all Babudom laid aside, smoking at noon on a cot,"
while a woman with turquoise-studded headgear points south-easterly
"across the bare grass. Litters, she says, do not travel as fast as"
"single men, but his birds should now be in the Plains. The holy man"
"would not stay though Lispeth pressed him. The Babu groans heavily,"
"girds up his huge loins, and is off again. He does not care to travel"
after dusk; but his daysâ  marchesâ there is none to enter them in a
"bookâ would astonish folk who mock at his race. Kindly villagers,"
"remembering the Dacca drug-vendor of two months ago, give him shelter"
"against evil spirits of the wood. He dreams of Bengali Gods, University"
"text-books of education, and the Royal Society, London, England. Next"
dawn the bobbing blue-and-white umbrella goes forward.

"On the edge of the Doon, Mussoorie well behind them and the Plains"
"spread out in golden dust before, rests a worn litter in whichâ all the"
Hills know itâ lies a sick lama who seeks a River for his healing.
"Villages have almost come to blows over the honour of bearing it, for"
"not only has the lama given them blessings, but his disciple good"
moneyâ full one-third Sahibsâ  prices. Twelve miles a day has the  dooli 
"travelled, as the greasy, rubbed pole-ends show, and by roads that few"
Sahibs use. Over the Nilang Pass in storm when the driven snow-dust
filled every fold of the impassive lamaâ s drapery; between the black
horns of Raieng where they heard the whistle of the wild goats through
the clouds; pitching and strained on the shale below; hard-held between
shoulder and clenched jaw when they rounded the hideous curves of the
Cut Road under Bhagirati; swinging and creaking to the steady jog-trot
of the descent into the Valley of the Waters; pressed along the steamy
"levels of that locked valley; up, up and out again, to meet the roaring"
gusts off Kedarnath; set down of mid-days in the dun gloom of kindly
"oak-forests; passed from village to village in dawn-chill, when even"
devotees may be forgiven for swearing at impatient holy men; or by
"torchlight, when the least fearful think of ghostsâ the  dooli  has"
reached her last stage. The little hill-folk sweat in the modified heat
"of the lower Siwaliks, and gather round the priests for their blessing"
and their wage.

"â Ye have acquired merit,â  says the lama. â Merit greater than your"
"knowing. And ye will return to the Hills,â  he sighs."

â Surely. The high Hills as soon as may be.â  The bearer rubs his
"shoulder, drinks water, spits it out again, and readjusts his grass"
sandal. Kimâ his face is drawn and tiredâ pays very small silver from his
"belt, heaves out the food-bag, crams an oilskin packetâ they are holy"
"writingsâ into his bosom, and helps the lama to his feet. The peace has"
"come again into the old manâ s eyes, and he does not look for the hills"
to fall down and crush him as he did that terrible night when they were
delayed by the flooded river.

The men pick up the  dooli  and swing out of sight between the scrub
clumps.

The lama raises a hand toward the rampart of the Himalayas. â Not with
"you, O blessed among all hills, fell the Arrow of Our Lord! And never"
shall I breathe your airs again!â 

"â But thou art ten times the stronger man in this good air,â  says Kim,"
"for to his wearied soul appeal the well-cropped, kindly Plains. â Here,"
"or hereabouts, fell the Arrow, yes. We will go very softly, perhaps, a"
" kos  a day, for the Search is sure. But the bag weighs heavy.â "

"â Ay, our Search is sure. I have come out of great temptation.â "

"It was never more than a couple of miles a day now, and Kimâ s shoulders"
"bore all the weight of itâ the burden of an old man, the burden of the"
"heavy food-bag with the locked books, the load of the writings on his"
"heart, and the details of the daily routine. He begged in the dawn, set"
"blankets for the lamaâ s meditation, held the weary head on his lap"
"through the noonday heats, fanning away the flies till his wrists"
"ached, begged again in the evenings, and rubbed the lamaâ s feet, who"
"rewarded him with promise of Freedomâ today, tomorrow, or, at furthest,"
the next day.

â Never was such a  chela . I doubt at times whether Ananda more
faithfully nursed Our Lord. And thou art a Sahib? When I was a manâ a
"long time agoâ I forgot that. Now I look upon thee often, and every time"
I remember that thou art a Sahib. It is strange.â 

â Thou hast said there is neither black nor white. Why plague me with
"this talk, Holy One? Let me rub the other foot. It vexes me. I am  not "
"a Sahib. I am thy  chela , and my head is heavy on my shoulders.â "

"â Patience a little! We reach Freedom together. Then thou and I, upon"
"the far bank of the River, will look back upon our lives as in the"
Hills we saw our daysâ  marches laid out behind us. Perhaps I was once a
Sahib.â 

"â Was never a Sahib like thee, I swear it.â "

â I am certain the Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House was in past
life a very wise Abbot. But even his spectacles do not make my eyes
see. There fall shadows when I would look steadily. No matterâ we know
the tricks of the poor stupid carcassâ shadow changing to another
shadow. I am bound by the illusion of Time and Space. How far came we
today in the flesh?â 

"â Perhaps half a koss.â  (Three quarters of a mile, and it was a weary"
march.)

"â Half a koss. Ha! I went ten thousand thousand in the spirit. How, we"
are all lapped and swathed and swaddled in these senseless things.â  He
looked at his thin blue-veined hand that found the beads so heavy.
"â  Chela , hast thou never a wish to leave me?â "

Kim thought of the oilskin packet and the books in the food-bag. If
someone duly authorized would only take delivery of them the Great Game
might play itself for aught he then cared. He was tired and hot in his
"head, and a cough that came from the stomach worried him."

â No.â  he said almost sternly. â I am not a dog or a snake to bite when I
have learned to love.â 

â Thou art too tender towards me.â 

â Not that either. I have moved in one matter without consulting thee. I
have sent a message to the Kulu woman by that woman who gave us the
"goatâ s milk this morn, saying that thou wast a little feeble and"
wouldst need a litter. I beat myself in my mind that I did not do it
when we entered the Doon. We stay in this place till the litter
returns.â 

"â I am content. She is a woman with a heart of gold, as thou sayest, but"
a talkerâ something of a talker.â 

"â She will not weary thee. I have looked to that also. Holy One, my"
heart is very heavy for my many carelessnesses towards thee.â  An
hysterical catch rose in his throat. â I have walked thee too far: I
have not picked good food always for thee; I have not considered the
heat; I have talked to people on the road and left thee alone ... I
haveâ I have ...  Hai mai!  But I love thee ... and it is all too late
"... I was a child ... Oh, why was I not a man? ...â  Overborne by"
"strain, fatigue, and the weight beyond his years, Kim broke down and"
sobbed at the lamaâ s feet.

â What a to-do is here!â  said the old man gently. â Thou hast never
"stepped a hairâ s breadth from the Way of Obedience. Neglect me? Child,"
I have lived on thy strength as an old tree lives on the lime of a new
"wall. Day by day, since Shamlegh down, I have stolen strength from"
"thee.  Therefore , not through any sin of thine, art thou weakened. It"
"is the Bodyâ the silly, stupid Bodyâ that speaks now. Not the assured"
Soul. Be comforted! Know at least the devils that thou fightest. They
are earth-bornâ children of illusion. We will go to the woman from Kulu.
"She shall acquire merit in housing us, and specially in tending me."
Thou shalt run free till strength returns. I had forgotten the stupid
"Body. If there be any blame, I bear it. But we are too close to the"
"Gates of Deliverance to weigh blame. I could praise thee, but what"
need? In a littleâ in a very littleâ we shall sit beyond all needs.â 

And so he petted and comforted Kim with wise saws and grave texts on
"that little-understood beast, our Body, who, being but a delusion,"
"insists on posing as the Soul, to the darkening of the Way, and the"
immense multiplication of unnecessary devils.

â Hai! hai! Let us talk of the woman from Kulu. Think you she will ask
"another charm for her grandsons? When I was a young man, a very long"
"time ago, I was plagued with these vapoursâ and some othersâ and I went"
"to an Abbotâ a very holy man and a seeker after truth, though then I"
"knew it not. Sit up and listen, child of my soul! My tale was told."
"Said he to me, â€˜ Chela , know this. There are many lies in the world,"
"and not a few liars, but there are no liars like our bodies, except it"
"be the sensations of our bodies.â  Considering this I was comforted, and"
of his great favour he suffered me to drink tea In his presence. Suffer
"me now to drink tea, for I am thirsty.â "

"With a laugh across his tears, Kim kissed the lamaâ s feet, and set"
about the tea-making.

"â Thou leanest on me in the body, Holy One, but I lean on thee for some"
other things. Dost know it?â 

"â I have guessed maybe,â  and the lamaâ s eyes twinkled. â We must change"
that.â 

"So, when with scufflings and scrapings and a hot air of importance,"
paddled up nothing less than the Sahibaâ s pet palanquin sent twenty
"miles, with that same grizzled old Oorya servant in charge, and when"
they reached the disorderly order of the long white rambling house
"behind Saharunpore, the lama took his own measures."

"Said the Sahiba cheerily from an upper window, after compliments: â What"
is the good of an old womanâ s advice to an old man? I told theeâ I
" told  thee, Holy One, to keep an eye upon the  chela . How didst thou"
do it? Never answer me!  I  know. He has been running among the women.
Look at his eyesâ hollow and sunkâ and the Betraying Line from the nose
"down! He has been sifted out! Fie! Fie! And a priest, too!â "

"Kim looked up, over-weary to smile, shaking his head in denial."

"â Do not jest,â  said the lama. â That time is done. We are here upon"
"great matters. A sickness of soul took me in the Hills, and him a"
sickness of the body. Since then I have lived upon his strengthâ eating
him.â 

"â Children togetherâ young and old,â  she sniffed, but forbore to make any"
new jokes. â May this present hospitality restore ye! Hold awhile and I
will come to gossip of the high good Hills.â 

"At evening timeâ her son-in-law was returned, so she did not need to go"
"on inspection round the farmâ she won to the meat of the matter,"
explained low-voicedly by the lama. The two old heads nodded wisely
"together. Kim had reeled to a room with a cot in it, and was dozing"
soddenly. The lama had forbidden him to set blankets or get food.

â I knowâ I know. Who but I?â  she cackled. â We who go down to the
burning-ghats clutch at the hands of those coming up from the River of
"Life with full water-jarsâ yes, brimming water-jars. I did the boy"
wrong. He lent thee his strength? It is true that the old eat the young
daily. Stands now we must restore him.â 

â Thou hast many times acquired meritâ â 

â  My  merit. What is it? Old bag of bones making curries for men who do
not ask â€˜Who cooked this?â  Now if it were stored up for my grandsonâ â 

â He that had the belly-pain?â 

â To think the Holy One remembers  that!  I must tell his mother. It is
most singular honour! â€˜He that had the belly-painâ â straightway the Holy
One remembered. She will be proud.â 

â My  chela  is to me as is a son to the unenlightened.â 

"â Say grandson, rather. Mothers have not the wisdom of our years. If a"
child cries they say the heavens are falling. Now a grandmother is far
enough separated from the pain of bearing and the pleasure of giving
the breast to consider whether a cry is wickedness pure or the wind.
"And since thou speakest once again of wind, when last the Holy One was"
"here, maybe I offended in pressing for charms.â "

"â Sister,â  said the lama, using that form of address a Buddhist monk may"
"sometimes employ towards a nun, â if charms comfort theeâ â "

â They are better than ten thousand doctors.â 

"â I say, if they comfort thee, I who was Abbot of Such-zen, will make as"
many as thou mayest desire. I have never seen thy faceâ â 

â  That  even the monkeys who steal our loquats count for again. Hee!
hee!â 

"â But as he who sleeps there said,â â he nodded at the shut door of the"
guest-chamber across the forecourtâ â thou hast a heart of gold... And he
is in the spirit my very â€˜grandsonâ  to me.â 

"â Good! I am the Holy Oneâ s cow.â  This was pure Hinduism, but the lama"
"never heeded. â I am old. I have borne sons in the body. Oh, once I"
could please men! Now I can cure them.â  He heard her armlets tinkle as
though she bared arms for action. â I will take over the boy and dose
"him, and stuff him, and make him all whole. Hai! hai! We old people"
know something yet.â 

"Wherefore when Kim, aching in every bone, opened his eyes, and would go"
"to the cook-house to get his masterâ s food, he found strong coercion"
"about him, and a veiled old figure at the door, flanked by the grizzled"
"manservant, who told him very precisely the things that he was on no"
account to do.

â Thou must have? Thou shalt have nothing. What? A locked box in which
"to keep holy books? Oh, that is another matter. Heavens forbid I should"
"come between a priest and his prayers! It shall be brought, and thou"
shalt keep the key.â 

"They pushed the coffer under his cot, and Kim shut away Mahbubâ s"
"pistol, the oilskin packet of letters, and the locked books and"
"diaries, with a groan of relief. For some absurd reason their weight on"
his shoulders was nothing to their weight on his poor mind. His neck
ached under it of nights.

â Thine is a sickness uncommon in youth these days: since young folk
"have given up tending their betters. The remedy is sleep, and certain"
"drugs,â  said the Sahiba; and he was glad to give himself up to the"
blankness that half menaced and half soothed him.

"She brewed drinks, in some mysterious Asiatic equivalent to the"
still-roomâ drenches that smelt pestilently and tasted worse. She stood
"over Kim till they went down, and inquired exhaustively after they had"
"come up. She laid a taboo upon the forecourt, and enforced it by means"
"of an armed man. It is true he was seventy odd, that his scabbarded"
sword ceased at the hilt; but he represented the authority of the
"Sahiba, and loaded wains, chattering servants, calves, dogs, hens, and"
"the like, fetched a wide compass by those parts. Best of all, when the"
"body was cleared, she cut out from the mass of poor relations that"
"crowded the back of the buildingsâ house-hold dogs, we name themâ a"
"cousinâ s widow, skilled in what Europeans, who know nothing about it,"
"call massage. And the two of them, laying him east and west, that the"
mysterious earth-currents which thrill the clay of our bodies might
"help and not hinder, took him to pieces all one long afternoonâ bone by"
"bone, muscle by muscle, ligament by ligament, and lastly, nerve by"
"nerve. Kneaded to irresponsible pulp, half hypnotized by the perpetual"
"flick and readjustment of the uneasy  chudders  that veiled their eyes,"
Kim slid ten thousand miles into slumberâ thirty-six hours of itâ sleep
that soaked like rain after drought.

"Then she fed him, and the house spun to her clamour. She caused fowls"
"to be slain; she sent for vegetables, and the sober, slow-thinking"
"gardener, nigh as old as she, sweated for it; she took spices, and"
"milk, and onion, with little fish from the brooksâ anon limes for"
"sherbets, fat quails from the pits, then chicken-livers upon a skewer,"
with sliced ginger between.

"â I have seen something of this world,â  she said over the crowded trays,"
â and there are but two sorts of women in itâ those who take the strength
"out of a man and those who put it back. Once I was that one, and now I"
am this. Nayâ do not play the priestling with me. Mine was but a jest.
"If it does not hold good now, it will when thou takest the road again."
"Cousin,â â this to the poor relation, never wearied of extolling her"
patronessâ s charityâ â he is getting a bloom on the skin of a new-curried
horse. Our work is like polishing jewels to be thrown to a
dance-girlâ eh?â 

Kim sat up and smiled. The terrible weakness had dropped from him like
"an old shoe. His tongue itched for free speech again, and but a week"
back the lightest word clogged it like ashes. The pain in his neck (he
must have caught it from the lama) had gone with the heavy dengue-aches
"and the evil taste in the mouth. The two old women, a little, but not"
"much, more careful about their veils now, clucked as merrily as the"
hens that had entered pecking through the open door.

â Where is my Holy One?â  he demanded.

"â Hear him! Thy Holy One is well,â  she snapped viciously. â Though that"
"is none of  his  merit. Knew I a charm to make him wise, Iâ d sell my"
jewels and buy it. To refuse good food that I cooked myselfâ and go
roving into the fields for two nights on an empty bellyâ and to tumble
"into a brook at the end of itâ call you  that  holiness? Then, when he"
"has nearly broken what thou hast left of my heart with anxiety, he"
"tells me that he has acquired merit. Oh, how like are all men! No, that"
was not itâ he tells me that he is freed from all sin.  I  could have
told him that before he wetted himself all over. He is well nowâ this
happened a week agoâ but burn me such holiness! A babe of three would do
better. Do not fret thyself for the Holy One. He keeps both eyes on
thee when he is not wading our brooks.â 

â I do not remember to have seen him. I remember that the days and
"nights passed like bars of white and black, opening and shutting. I was"
not sick: I was but tired.â 

â A lethargy that comes by right some few score years later. But it is
done now.â 

"â Maharanee,â  Kim began, but led by the look in her eye, changed it to"
"the title of plain loveâ â Mother, I owe my life to thee. How shall I"
make thanks? Ten thousand blessings upon thy house andâ â 

â The house be unblessed!â  (It is impossible to give exactly the old
"ladyâ s word.) â Thank the Gods as a priest if thou wilt, but thank me,"
"if thou carest, as a son. Heavens above! Have I shifted thee and lifted"
thee and slapped and twisted thy ten toes to find texts flung at my
head? Somewhere a mother must have borne thee to break her heart. What
used thou to herâ son?â 

"â I had no mother, my mother,â  said Kim. â She died, they tell me, when I"
was young.â 

â  Hai mai!  Then none can say I have robbed her of any right ifâ when
thou takest the road again and this house is but one of a thousand used
"for shelter and forgotten, after an easy-flung blessing. No matter. I"
"need no blessings, butâ butâ â  She stamped her foot at the poor relation."
â Take up the trays to the house. What is the good of stale food in the
"room, O woman of ill-omen?â "

"â I haâ have borne a son in my time too, but he died,â  whimpered the"
bowed sister-figure behind the  chudder . â Thou knowest he died! I only
waited for the order to take away the tray.â 

"â It is I that am the woman of ill-omen,â  cried the old lady penitently."
â We that go down to the  chattris  (the big umbrellas above the
burning-ghats where the priests take their last dues) clutch hard at
the bearers of the  chattis  (water-jarsâ young folk full of the pride
"of life, she meant; but the pun is clumsy). When one cannot dance in"
"the festival one must eâ en look out of the window, and grandmothering"
takes all a womanâ s time. Thy master gives me all the charms I now
"desire for my daughterâ s eldest, by reasonâ is it?â that he is wholly"
free from sin. The  hakim  is brought very low these days. He goes
about poisoning my servants for lack of their betters.â 

"â What  hakim , mother?â "

â That very Dacca man who gave me the pill which rent me in three
"pieces. He cast up like a strayed camel a week ago, vowing that he and"
"thou had been blood-brothers together up Kulu-way, and feigning great"
"anxiety for thy health. He was very thin and hungry, so I gave orders"
to have him stuffed tooâ him and his anxiety!â 

â I would see him if he is here.â 

"â He eats five times a day, and lances boils for my hinds to save"
himself from an apoplexy. He is so full of anxiety for thy health that
he sticks to the cook-house door and stays himself with scraps. He will
keep. We shall never get rid of him.â 

"â Send him here, motherâ â the twinkle returned to Kimâ s eye for a"
flashâ â and I will try.â 

"â Iâ ll send him, but to chase him off is an ill turn. At least he had"
"the sense to fish the Holy One out of the brook; thus, as the Holy One"
"did  not  say, acquiring merit.â "

"â He is a very wise  hakim . Send him, mother.â "

â Priest praising priest? A miracle! If he is any friend of thine (ye
squabbled at your last meeting) Iâ ll hale him here with horse-ropes
"andâ and give him a caste-dinner afterwards, my son ... Get up and see"
the world! This lying abed is the mother of seventy devils ... my son!
my son!â 

"She trotted forth to raise a typhoon off the cook-house, and almost on"
"her shadow rolled in the Babu, robed as to the shoulders like a Roman"
"emperor, jowled like Titus, bare-headed, with new patent-leather shoes,"
"in highest condition of fat, exuding joy and salutations."

"â By Jove, Mister Oâ Hara, but I  am  jolly glad to see you. I will"
kindly shut the door. It is a pity you are sick. Are you very sick?â 

â The papersâ the papers from the  kilta . The maps and the  murasla! â 
He held out the key impatiently; for the present need on his soul was
to get rid of the loot.

â You are quite right. That is correct Departmental view to take. You
have got everything?â 

â All that was handwritten in the  kilta  I took. The rest I threw down
"the hill.â  He could hear the keyâ s grate in the lock, the sticky pull"
"of the slow-rending oilskin, and a quick shuffling of papers. He had"
been annoyed out of all reason by the knowledge that they lay below him
through the sick idle daysâ a burden incommunicable. For that reason the
"blood tingled through his body, when Hurree, skipping elephantinely,"
shook hands again.

â This is fine! This is finest! Mister Oâ Hara! you haveâ ha! ha! swiped
"the whole bag of tricksâ locks, stocks, and barrels. They told me it was"
"eight monthsâ  work gone up the spouts! By Jove, how they beat me! ..."
"Look, here is the letter from HilÃ¡s!â  He intoned a line or two of Court"
"Persian, which is the language of authorized and unauthorized"
diplomacy. â Mister Rajah Sahib has just about put his foot in the
holes. He will have to explain offeecially how the deuce-anâ -all he is
writing love-letters to the Czar. And they are very clever maps ... and
there is three or four Prime Ministers of these parts implicated by the
"correspondence. By Gad, sar! The British Government will change the"
"succession in HilÃ¡s and BunÃ¡r, and nominate new heirs to the throne."
â€˜Trea-son most baseâ  ... but you do not understand? Eh?â 

â Are they in thy hands?â  said Kim. It was all he cared for.

â Just you jolly-well bet yourself they are.â  He stowed the entire trove
"about his body, as only Orientals can. â They are going up to the"
"office, too. The old lady thinks I am permanent fixture here, but I"
shall go away with these straight offâ immediately. Mr Lurgan will be
"proud man. You are offeecially subordinate to me, but I shall embody"
your name in my verbal report. It is a pity we are not allowed written
reports. We Bengalis excel in thee exact science.â  He tossed back the
key and showed the box empty.

"â Good. That is good. I was very tired. My Holy One was sick, too. And"
did he fall intoâ â 

"â Oah yess. I am his good friend, I tell you. He was behaving very"
"strange when I came down after you, and I thought perhaps he might have"
"the papers. I followed him on his meditations, and to discuss"
"ethnological points also. You see, I am verree small person here"
"nowadays, in comparison with all his charms. By Jove, Oâ Hara, do you"
"know, he is afflicted with infirmity of fits. Yess, I tell you."
"Cataleptic, too, if not also epileptic. I found him in such a state"
"under a tree  in articulo mortem , and he jumped up and walked into a"
brook and he was nearly drowned but for me. I pulled him out.â 

â Because I was not there!â  said Kim. â He might have died.â 

"â Yes, he might have died, but he is dry now, and asserts he has"
undergone transfiguration.â  The Babu tapped his forehead knowingly. â I
took notes of his statements for Royal Societyâ  in posse . You must
"make haste and be quite well and come back to Simla, and I will tell"
you all my tale at Lurganâ s. It was splendid. The bottoms of their
"trousers were  quite  torn, and old Nahan Rajah, he thought they were"
European soldiers deserting.â 

"â Oh, the Russians? How long were they with thee?â "

"â One was a Frenchman. Oh, days and days and days! Now all the"
hill-people believe all Russians are all beggars. By Jove! they had not
one damâ -thing that I did not get them. And I told the common
"peopleâ oah,  such  tales and anecdotes!â I will tell you at old Lurganâ s"
when you come up. We will haveâ ahâ a night out! It is feather in both
"our caps! Yess, and they gave me a certificate. That is creaming joke."
You should have seen them at the Alliance Bank identifying themselves!
And thank Almighty God you got their papers so well! You do not laugh
"verree much, but you shall laugh when you are well. Now I will go"
straight to the railway and get out. You shall have all sorts of
credits for your game. When do you come along? We are very proud of you
though you gave us great frights. And especially Mahbub.â 

"â Ay, Mahbub. And where is he?â "

"â Selling horses in this vi-cinity, of course.â "

â Here! Why? Speak slowly. There is a thickness in my head still.â 

"The Babu looked shyly down his nose. â Well, you see, I am fearful man,"
"and I do not like responsibility. You were sick, you see, and I did not"
"know where deuce-anâ -all the papers were, and if so, how many. So when"
I had come down here I slipped in private wire to Mahbubâ he was at
Meerut for racesâ and I tell him how case stands. He comes up with his
"men and he consorts with the lama, and then he calls me a fool, and is"
very rudeâ â 

â But whereforeâ wherefore?â 

â That is what  I  ask. I only suggest that if anyone steals the papers
"I should like some good strong, brave men to rob them back again. You"
"see, they are vitally important, and Mahbub Ali he did not know where"
you were.â 

"â Mahbub Ali to rob the Sahibaâ s house? Thou art mad, Babu,â  said Kim"
with indignation.

â I wanted the papers. Suppose she had stole them? It was only practical
"suggestion, I think. You are not pleased, eh?â "

A native proverbâ unquotableâ showed the blackness of Kimâ s disapproval.

"â Well,â â Hurree shrugged his shouldersâ â there is no accounting for thee"
"taste. Mahbub was angry too. He has sold horses all about here, and he"
says old lady is  pukka  (thorough) old lady and would not condescend
"to such ungentlemanly things.  I  do not care. I have got the papers,"
"and I was very glad of moral support from Mahbub. I tell you, I am"
"fearful man, but, somehow or other, the more fearful I am the more"
"damâ -tight places I get into. So I was glad you came with me to Chini,"
and I am glad Mahbub was close by. The old lady she is sometimes very
rude to me and my beautiful pills.â 

"â Allah be merciful!â  said Kim on his elbow, rejoicing. â What a beast of"
wonder is a Babu! And that man walked aloneâ if he did walkâ with robbed
and angry foreigners!â 

"â Oah, thatt was nothing, after they had done beating me; but if I lost"
"the papers it was pretty-jolly serious. Mahbub he nearly beat me too,"
and he went and consorted with the lama no end. I shall stick to
"ethnological investigations henceforwards. Now good-bye, Mister Oâ Hara."
I can catch 4.25 p.m. to Umballa if I am quick. It will be good times
when we all tell thee tale up at Mr Lurganâ s. I shall report you
"offeecially better. Good-bye, my dear fallow, and when next you are"
under thee emotions please do not use the Mohammedan terms with the
Tibetan dress.â 

He shook hands twiceâ a Babu to his boot-heelsâ and opened the door. With
the fall of the sunlight upon his still triumphant face he returned to
the humble Dacca quack.

"â He robbed them,â  thought Kim, forgetting his own share in the game."
â He tricked them. He lied to them like a Bengali. They give him a
 chit  (a testimonial). He makes them a mock at the risk of his
lifeâ  I  never would have gone down to them after the pistol-shotsâ and
then he says he is a fearful man ... And he  is  a fearful man. I must
get into the world again.â 

"At first his legs bent like bad pipe-stems, and the flood and rush of"
"the sunlit air dazzled him. He squatted by the white wall, the mind"
"rummaging among the incidents of the long  dooli  journey, the lamaâ s"
"weaknesses, and, now that the stimulus of talk was removed, his own"
"self-pity, of which, like the sick, he had great store. The unnerved"
"brain edged away from all the outside, as a raw horse, once rowelled,"
"sidles from the spur. It was enough, amply enough, that the spoil of"
the  kilta  was awayâ off his handsâ out of his possession. He tried to
think of the lamaâ to wonder why he had tumbled into a brookâ but the
"bigness of the world, seen between the forecourt gates, swept linked"
"thought aside. Then he looked upon the trees and the broad fields, with"
the thatched huts hidden among cropsâ looked with strange eyes unable to
take up the size and proportion and use of thingsâ stared for a still
"half-hour. All that while he felt, though he could not put it into"
"words, that his soul was out of gear with its surroundingsâ a cog-wheel"
"unconnected with any machinery, just like the idle cog-wheel of a cheap"
"Beheea sugar-crusher laid by in a corner. The breezes fanned over him,"
"the parrots shrieked at him, the noises of the populated house"
"behindâ squabbles, orders, and reproofsâ hit on dead ears."

â I am Kim. I am Kim. And what is Kim?â  His soul repeated it again and
again.

He did not want to cryâ had never felt less like crying in his lifeâ but
"of a sudden easy, stupid tears trickled down his nose, and with an"
almost audible click he felt the wheels of his being lock up anew on
the world without. Things that rode meaningless on the eyeball an
instant before slid into proper proportion. Roads were meant to be
"walked upon, houses to be lived in, cattle to be driven, fields to be"
"tilled, and men and women to be talked to. They were all real and"
trueâ solidly planted upon the feetâ perfectly comprehensibleâ clay of his
"clay, neither more nor less. He shook himself like a dog with a flea in"
"his ear, and rambled out of the gate. Said the Sahiba, to whom watchful"
eyes reported this move: â Let him go. I have done my share. Mother
"Earth must do the rest. When the Holy One comes back from meditation,"
tell him.â 

"There stood an empty bullock-cart on a little knoll half a mile away,"
"with a young banyan tree behindâ a look-out, as it were, above some"
"new-ploughed levels; and his eyelids, bathed in soft air, grew heavy as"
"he neared it. The ground was good clean dustâ no new herbage that,"
"living, is half-way to death already, but the hopeful dust that holds"
"the seeds of all life. He felt it between his toes, patted it with his"
"palms, and joint by joint, sighing luxuriously, laid him down full"
length along in the shadow of the wooden-pinned cart. And Mother Earth
was as faithful as the Sahiba. She breathed through him to restore the
poise he had lost lying so long on a cot cut off from her good
"currents. His head lay powerless upon her breast, and his opened hands"
"surrendered to her strength. The many-rooted tree above him, and even"
"the dead manhandled wood beside, knew what he sought, as he himself did"
not know. Hour upon hour he lay deeper than sleep.

"Towards evening, when the dust of returning kine made all the horizons"
"smoke, came the lama and Mahbub Ali, both afoot, walking cautiously,"
for the house had told them where he had gone.

â Allah! What a foolâ s trick to play in open country!â  muttered the
horse-dealer. â He could be shot a hundred timesâ but this is not the
Border.â 

"â And,â  said the lama, repeating a many-times-told tale, â never was such"
"a  chela . Temperate, kindly, wise, of ungrudging disposition, a merry"
"heart upon the road, never forgetting, learned, truthful, courteous."
Great is his reward!â 

â I know the boyâ as I have said.â 

â And he was all those things?â 

â Some of themâ but I have not yet found a Red Hatâ s charm for making him
overly truthful. He has certainly been well nursed.â 

"â The Sahiba is a heart of gold,â  said the lama earnestly. â She looks"
upon him as her son.â 

â Hmph! Half Hind seems that way disposed. I only wished to see that the
"boy had come to no harm and was a free agent. As thou knowest, he and I"
were old friends in the first days of your pilgrimage together.â 

â That is a bond between us.â  The lama sat down. â We are at the end of
the pilgrimage.â 

â No thanks to thee thine was not cut off for good and all a week back.
I heard what the Sahiba said to thee when we bore thee up on the cot.â 
"Mahbub laughed, and tugged his newly dyed beard."

â I was meditating upon other matters that tide. It was the  hakim  from
Dacca broke my meditations.â 

â Otherwiseâ â this was in Pushtu for decencyâ s sakeâ â thou wouldst have
ended thy meditations upon the sultry side of Hellâ being an unbeliever
"and an idolater for all thy childâ s simplicity. But now, Red Hat, what"
is to be done?â 

"â This very night,â â the words came slowly, vibrating with triumphâ â this"
very night he will be as free as I am from all taint of sinâ assured as
"I am, when he quits this body, of Freedom from the Wheel of Things. I"
have a signâ â he laid his hand above the torn chart in his bosomâ â that
my time is short; but I shall have safeguarded him throughout the
"years. Remember, I have reached Knowledge, as I told thee only three"
nights back.â 

"â It must be true, as the Tirah priest said when I stole his cousinâ s"
"wife, that I am a  sufi  (a free-thinker); for here I sit,â  said Mahbub"
"to himself, â drinking in blasphemy unthinkable ... I remember the tale."
"On that, then, he goes to  Jannatu lâ Adn  (the Gardens of Eden). But"
how? Wilt thou slay him or drown him in that wonderful river from which
the Babu dragged thee?â 

"â I was dragged from no river,â  said the lama simply. â Thou hast"
forgotten what befell. I found it by Knowledge.â 

"â Oh, ay. True,â  stammered Mahbub, divided between high indignation and"
enormous mirth. â I had forgotten the exact run of what happened. Thou
didst find it knowingly.â 

"â And to say that I would take life isâ not a sin, but a madness simple."
My  chela  aided me to the River. It is his right to be cleansed from
sinâ with me.â 

"â Ay, he needs cleansing. But afterwards, old manâ afterwards?â "

â What matter under all the Heavens? He is sure of Nibbanâ enlightenedâ as
I am.â 

â Well said. I had a fear he might mount Mohammedâ s Horse and fly away.â 

â Nayâ he must go forth as a teacher.â 

â Aha! Now I see! That is the right gait for the colt. Certainly he must
go forth as a teacher. He is somewhat urgently needed as a scribe by
"the State, for instance.â "

â To that end he was prepared. I acquired merit in that I gave alms for
his sake. A good deed does not die. He aided me in my Search. I aided
"him in his. Just is the Wheel, O horse-seller from the North. Let him"
be a teacher; let him be a scribeâ what matter? He will have attained
Freedom at the end. The rest is illusion.â 

â What matter? When I must have him with me beyond Balkh in six months!
I come up with ten lame horses and three strong-backed menâ thanks to
that chicken of a Babuâ to break a sick boy by force out of an old
trotâ s house. It seems that I stand by while a young Sahib is hoisted
into Allah knows what of an idolaterâ s Heaven by means of old Red Hat.
And I am reckoned something of a player of the Game myself! But the
madman is fond of the boy; and I must be very reasonably mad too.â 

"â What is the prayer?â  said the lama, as the rough Pushtu rumbled into"
the red beard.

"â No matter at all; but now I understand that the boy, sure of Paradise,"
"can yet enter Government service, my mind is easier. I must get to my"
horses. It grows dark. Do not wake him. I have no wish to hear him call
thee master.â 

â But he  is  my disciple. What else?â 

â He has told me.â  Mahbub choked down his touch of spleen and rose
"laughing. â I am not altogether of thy faith, Red Hatâ if so small a"
matter concern thee.â 

"â It is nothing,â  said the lama."

"â I thought not. Therefore it will not move thee, sinless, new-washed"
"and three parts drowned to boot, when I call thee a good manâ a very"
"good man. We have talked together some four or five evenings now, and"
"for all I am a horse-coper I can still, as the saying is, see holiness"
"beyond the legs of a horse. Yea, can see, too, how our Friend of all"
"the World put his hand in thine at the first. Use him well, and suffer"
"him to return to the world as a teacher, when thou hastâ bathed his"
"legs, if that be the proper medicine for the colt.â "

"â Why not follow the Way thyself, and so accompany the boy?â "

"Mahbub stared stupefied at the magnificent insolence of the demand,"
which across the Border he would have paid with more than a blow. Then
the humour of it touched his worldly soul.

"â Softlyâ softlyâ one foot at a time, as the lame gelding went over the"
Umballa jumps. I may come to Paradise laterâ I have workings that
wayâ great motionsâ and I owe them to thy simplicity. Thou hast never
lied?â 

â What need?â 

"â O Allah, hear him! â€˜What needâ  in this Thy world! Nor ever harmed a"
man?â 

â Onceâ with a pencaseâ before I was wise.â 

â So? I think the better of thee. Thy teachings are good. Thou hast
turned one man that I know from the path of strife.â  He laughed
immensely. â He came here open-minded to commit a  dacoity  (a
"house-robbery with violence). Yes, to cut, rob, kill, and carry off"
what he desired.â 

â A great foolishness!â 

â Oh! black shame too. So he thought after he had seen theeâ and a few
"others, male and female. So he abandoned it; and now he goes to beat a"
big fat Babu man.â 

â I do not understand.â 

"â Allah forbid it! Some men are strong in knowledge, Red Hat. Thy"
strength is stronger still. Keep itâ I think thou wilt. If the boy be
"not a good servant, pull his ears off.â "

With a hitch of his broad Bokhariot belt the Pathan swaggered off into
"the gloaming, and the lama came down from his clouds so far as to look"
at the broad back.

"â That person lacks courtesy, and is deceived by the shadow of"
"appearances. But he spoke well of my  chela , who now enters upon his"
"reward. Let me make the prayer! ... Wake, O fortunate above all born of"
women. Wake! It is found!â 

"Kim came up from those deep wells, and the lama attended his yawning"
pleasure; duly snapping fingers to head off evil spirits.

"â I have slept a hundred years. Whereâ ? Holy One, hast  thou  been here"
"long? I went out to look for thee, butâ â he laughed drowsilyâ â I slept by"
the way. I am all well now. Hast thou eaten? Let us go to the house. It
is many days since I tended thee. And the Sahiba fed thee well? Who
"shampooed thy legs? What of the weaknessesâ the belly and the neck, and"
the beating in the ears?â 

â Goneâ all gone. Dost thou not know?â 

"â I know nothing, but that I have not seen thee in a monkeyâ s age. Know"
what?â 

"â Strange the knowledge did not reach out to thee, when all my thoughts"
were theeward.â 

"â I cannot see the face, but the voice is like a gong. Has the Sahiba"
made a young man of thee by her cookery?â 

"He peered at the cross-legged figure, outlined jet-black against the"
lemon-coloured drift of light. So does the stone Bodhisat sit who looks
down upon the patent self-registering turnstiles of the Lahore Museum.

The lama held his peace. Except for the click of the rosary and a faint
" clop-clop  of Mahbubâ s retreating feet, the soft, smoky silence of"
evening in India wrapped them close.

â Hear me! I bring news.â 

â But let usâ â 

Out shot the long yellow hand compelling silence. Kim tucked his feet
under his robe-edge obediently.

â Hear me! I bring news! The Search is finished. Comes now the Reward...
"Thus. When we were among the Hills, I lived on thy strength till the"
"young branch bowed and nigh broke. When we came out of the Hills, I was"
troubled for thee and for other matters which I held in my heart. The
boat of my soul lacked direction; I could not see into the Cause of
Things. So I gave thee over to the virtuous woman altogether. I took no
food. I drank no water. Still I saw not the Way. They pressed food upon
me and cried at my shut door. So I removed myself to a hollow under a
tree. I took no food. I took no water. I sat in meditation two days and
"two nights, abstracting my mind; inbreathing and outbreathing in the"
required manner ... Upon the second nightâ so great was my rewardâ the
wise Soul loosed itself from the silly Body and went free. This I have
"never before attained, though I have stood on the threshold of it."
"Consider, for it is a marvel!â "

â A marvel indeed. Two days and two nights without food! Where was the
Sahiba?â  said Kim under his breath.

"â Yea, my Soul went free, and, wheeling like an eagle, saw indeed that"
"there was no Teshoo Lama nor any other soul. As a drop draws to water,"
so my Soul drew near to the Great Soul which is beyond all things. At
"that point, exalted in contemplation, I saw all Hind, from Ceylon in"
"the sea to the Hills, and my own Painted Rocks at Such-zen; I saw every"
"camp and village, to the least, where we have ever rested. I saw them"
at one time and in one place; for they were within the Soul. By this I
knew the Soul had passed beyond the illusion of Time and Space and of
"Things. By this I knew that I was free. I saw thee lying in thy cot,"
"and I saw thee falling downhill under the idolaterâ at one time, in one"
"place, in my Soul, which, as I say, had touched the Great Soul. Also I"
"saw the stupid body of Teshoo Lama lying down, and the  hakim  from"
"Dacca kneeled beside, shouting in its ear. Then my Soul was all alone,"
"and I saw nothing, for I was all things, having reached the Great Soul."
"And I meditated a thousand thousand years, passionless, well aware of"
the Causes of all Things. Then a voice cried: â€˜What shall come to the
boy if thou art dead?â  and I was shaken back and forth in myself with
"pity for thee; and I said: â€˜I will return to my  chela , lest he miss"
"the Way.â  Upon this my Soul, which is the Soul of Teshoo Lama, withdrew"
itself from the Great Soul with strivings and yearnings and retchings
"and agonies not to be told. As the egg from the fish, as the fish from"
"the water, as the water from the cloud, as the cloud from the thick"
"air, so put forth, so leaped out, so drew away, so fumed up the Soul of"
Teshoo Lama from the Great Soul. Then a voice cried: â€˜The River! Take
"heed to the River!â  and I looked down upon all the world, which was as"
"I had seen it beforeâ one in time, one in placeâ and I saw plainly the"
River of the Arrow at my feet. At that hour my Soul was hampered by
"some evil or other whereof I was not wholly cleansed, and it lay upon"
"my arms and coiled round my waist; but I put it aside, and I cast forth"
as an eagle in my flight for the very place of the River. I pushed
aside world upon world for thy sake. I saw the River below meâ the River
"of the Arrowâ and, descending, the waters of it closed over me; and"
"behold I was again in the body of Teshoo Lama, but free from sin, and"
the  hakim  from Decca bore up my head in the waters of the River. It
is here! It is behind the mango-tope hereâ even here!â 

"â Allah kerim! Oh, well that the Babu was by! Wast thou very wet?â "

â Why should I regard? I remember the  hakim  was concerned for the body
"of Teshoo Lama. He haled it out of the holy water in his hands, and"
there came afterwards thy horse-seller from the North with a cot and
"men, and they put the body on the cot and bore it up to the Sahibaâ s"
house.â 

â What said the Sahiba?â 

"â I was meditating in that body, and did not hear. So thus the Search is"
"ended. For the merit that I have acquired, the River of the Arrow is"
"here. It broke forth at our feet, as I have said. I have found it. Son"
"of my Soul, I have wrenched my Soul back from the Threshold of Freedom"
"to free thee from all sinâ as I am free, and sinless! Just is the Wheel!"
Certain is our deliverance! Come!â 

"He crossed his hands on his lap and smiled, as a man may who has won"
salvation for himself and his beloved.

THE PHANTOM â€˜RICKSHAW

"May no ill dreams disturb my rest,"
Nor Powers of Darkness me molest.
#NAME?

One of the few advantages that India has over England is a great
Knowability. After five yearsâ  service a man is directly or indirectly
"acquainted with the two or three hundred Civilians in his Province, all"
"the Messes of ten or twelve Regiments and Batteries, and some fifteen"
hundred other people of the non-official caste. In ten years his
"knowledge should be doubled, and at the end of twenty he knows, or knows"
"something about, every Englishman in the Empire, and may travel anywhere"
and everywhere without paying hotel-bills.

"Globe-trotters who expect entertainment as a right, have, even within my"
"memory, blunted this open-heartedness, but none the less to-day, if you"
"belong to the Inner Circle and are neither a Bear nor a Black Sheep,"
"all houses are open to you, and our small world is very, very kind and"
helpful.

Rickett of Kamartha stayed with Polder of Kumaon some fifteen years ago.
"He meant to stay two nights, but was knocked down by rheumatic fever,"
"and for six weeks disorganized Polderâ s establishment, stopped Polderâ s"
"work, and nearly died in Polderâ s bedroom. Polder behaves as though he"
"had been placed under eternal obligation by Rickett, and yearly"
sends the little Ricketts a box of presents and toys. It is the same
everywhere. The men who do not take the trouble to conceal from you
"their opinion that you are an incompetent ass, and the women who blacken"
"your character and misunderstand your wifeâ s amusements, will work"
themselves to the bone in your behalf if you fall sick or into serious
trouble.

"Heatherlegh, the Doctor, kept, in addition to his regular practice,"
a hospital on his private account--an arrangement of loose boxes for
"Incurables, his friend called it--but it was really a sort of fitting-up"
shed for craft that had been damaged by stress of weather. The weather
"in India is often sultry, and since the tale of bricks is always a fixed"
"quantity, and the only liberty allowed is permission to work overtime"
"and get no thanks, men occasionally break down and become as mixed as"
the metaphors in this sentence.

"Heatherlegh is the dearest doctor that ever was, and his invariable"
"prescription to all his patients is, â lie low, go slow, and keep cool.â "
He says that more men are killed by overwork than the importance of this
"world justifies. He maintains that overwork slew Pansay, who died under"
"his hands about three years ago. He has, of course, the right to speak"
"authoritatively, and he laughs at my theory that there was a crack"
in Pansayâ s head and a little bit of the Dark World came through and
"pressed him to death. â Pansay went off the handle,â  says Heatherlegh,"
â after the stimulus of long leave at Home. He may or he may not have
behaved like a blackguard to Mrs. Keith-Wessington. My notion is that
"the work of the Katabundi Settlement ran him off his legs, and that he"
took to brooding and making much of an ordinary P. & O. flirtation. He
"certainly was engaged to Miss Mannering, and she certainly broke off the"
engagement. Then he took a feverish chill and all that nonsense about
"ghosts developed. Overwork started his illness, kept it alight, and"
killed him poor devil. Write him off to the System--one man to take the
work of two and a half men.â 

I do not believe this. I used to sit up with Pansay sometimes when
"Heatherlegh was called out to patients, and I happened to be within"
"claim. The man would make me most unhappy by describing in a low, even"
"voice, the procession that was always passing at the bottom of his bed."
He had a sick manâ s command of language. When he recovered I suggested
"that he should write out the whole affair from beginning to end, knowing"
that ink might assist him to ease his mind. When little boys have
learned a new bad word they are never happy till they have chalked it up
on a door. And this also is Literature.

"He was in a high fever while he was writing, and the blood-and-thunder"
Magazine diction he adopted did not calm him. Two months afterward
"he was reported fit for duty, but, in spite of the fact that he was"
urgently needed to help an undermanned Commission stagger through a
"deficit, he preferred to die; vowing at the last that he was hag-ridden."
"I got his manuscript before he died, and this is his version of the"
"affair, dated 1885:"

My doctor tells me that I need rest and change of air. It is not
improbable that I shall get both ere long--rest that neither the
"red-coated messenger nor the midday gun can break, and change of air"
far beyond that which any homeward-bound steamer can give me. In the
"meantime I am resolved to stay where I am; and, in flat defiance of my"
"doctorâ s orders, to take all the world into my confidence. You shall"
"learn for yourselves the precise nature of my malady; and shall, too,"
judge for yourselves whether any man born of woman on this weary earth
was ever so tormented as I.

Speaking now as a condemned criminal might speak ere the drop-bolts are
"drawn, my story, wild and hideously improbable as it may appear,"
demands at least attention. That it will ever receive credence I utterly
disbelieve. Two months ago I should have scouted as mad or drunk the man
who had dared tell me the like. Two months ago I was the happiest man in
"India. Today, from Peshawur to the sea, there is no one more wretched."
"My doctor and I are the only two who know this. His explanation is, that"
"my brain, digestion, and eyesight are all slightly affected; giving rise"
"to my frequent and persistent â delusions.â  Delusions, indeed! I call him"
"a fool; but he attends me still with the same unwearied smile, the same"
"bland professional manner, the same neatly trimmed red whiskers, till I"
"begin to suspect that I am an ungrateful, evil-tempered invalid. But you"
shall judge for your-selves.

Three years ago it was my fortune--my great misfortune--to sail
"from Gravesend to Bombay, on return from long leave, with one Agnes"
"Keith-Wessington, wife of an officer on the Bombay side. It does not in"
the least concern you to know what manner of woman she was. Be content
"with the knowledge that, ere the voyage had ended, both she and I were"
desperately and unreasoningly in love with one another. Heaven knows
that I can make the admission now without one particle of vanity. In
matters of this sort there is always one who gives and another who
"accepts. From the first day of our ill-omened attachment, I was"
"conscious that Agnesâ s passion was a stronger, a more dominant, and--if"
I may use the expression--a purer sentiment than mine. Whether she
"recognized the fact then, I do not know. Afterward it was bitterly plain"
to both of us.

"Arrived at Bombay in the spring of the year, we went our respective"
"ways, to meet no more for the next three or four months, when my leave"
and her love took us both to Simla. There we spent the season together;
and there my fire of straw burned itself out to a pitiful end with the
closing year. I attempt no excuse. I make no apology. Mrs. Wessington
"had given up much for my sake, and was prepared to give up all. From my"
"own lips, in August, 1882, she learned that I was sick of her presence,"
"tired of her company, and weary of the sound of her voice. Ninety-nine"
women out of a hundred would have wearied of me as I wearied of them;
seventy-five of that number would have promptly avenged themselves by
active and obtrusive flirtation with other men. Mrs. Wessington was the
hundredth. On her neither my openly expressed aversion nor the cutting
brutalities with which I garnished our interviews had the least effect.

"â Jack, darling!â  was her one eternal cuckoo cry: â Iâ m sure itâ s all a"
mistake--a hideous mistake; and weâ ll be good friends again some day.
" Please  forgive me, Jack, dear.â "

"I was the offender, and I knew it. That knowledge transformed my pity"
"into passive endurance, and, eventually, into blind hate--the same"
"instinct, I suppose, which prompts a man to savagely stamp on the spider"
he has but half killed. And with this hate in my bosom the season of
1882 came to an end.

Next year we met again at Simla--she with her monotonous face and timid
"attempts at reconciliation, and I with loathing of her in every fibre of"
my frame. Several times I could not avoid meeting her alone; and on each
occasion her words were identically the same. Still the unreasoning wail
that it was all a â mistakeâ ; and still the hope of eventually â making
"friends.â  I might have seen had I cared to look, that that hope only was"
keeping her alive. She grew more wan and thin month by month. You will
"agree with me, at least, that such conduct would have driven any one to"
despair. It was uncalled for; childish; unwomanly. I maintain that she
"was much to blame. And again, sometimes, in the black, fever-stricken"
"night-watches, I have begun to think that I might have been a little"
kinder to her. But that really is a â delusion.â  I could not have
continued pretending to love her when I didnâ t; could I? It would have
been unfair to us both.

Last year we met again--on the same terms as before. The same weary
"appeal, and the same curt answers from my lips. At least I would make"
her see how wholly wrong and hopeless were her attempts at resuming the
"old relationship. As the season wore on, we fell apart--that is to say,"
"she found it difficult to meet me, for I had other and more absorbing"
"interests to attend to. When I think it over quietly in my sick-room,"
the season of 1884 seems a confused nightmare wherein light and shade
were fantastically intermingled--my courtship of little Kitty Mannering;
"my hopes, doubts, and fears; our long rides together; my trembling"
avowal of attachment; her reply; and now and again a vision of a white
face flitting by in the â€˜rickshaw with the black and white liveries
I once watched for so earnestly; the wave of Mrs. Wessingtonâ s gloved
"hand; and, when she met me alone, which was but seldom, the irksome"
"monotony of her appeal. I loved Kitty Mannering; honestly, heartily"
"loved her, and with my love for her grew my hatred for Agnes. In August"
Kitty and I were engaged. The next day I met those accursed â magpieâ 
" jhampanies  at the back of Jakko, and, moved by some passing sentiment"
"of pity, stopped to tell Mrs. Wessington everything. She knew it"
already.

"â So I hear youâ re engaged, Jack dear.â  Then, without a momentâ s pause:"
â Iâ m sure itâ s all a mistake--a hideous mistake. We shall be as good
"friends some day, Jack, as we ever were.â "

My answer might have made even a man wince. It cut the dying woman
"before me like the blow of a whip. â Please forgive me, Jack; I didnâ t"
"mean to make you angry; but itâ s true, itâ s true!â "

And Mrs. Wessington broke down completely. I turned away and left her to
"finish her journey in peace, feeling, but only for a moment or two, that"
"I had been an unutterably mean hound. I looked back, and saw that she"
"had turned her â€˜rickshaw with the idea, I suppose, of overtaking me."

The scene and its surroundings were photographed on my memory. The
"rain-swept sky (we were at the end of the wet weather), the sodden,"
"dingy pines, the muddy road, and the black powder-riven cliffs formed"
a gloomy background against which the black and white liveries of
"the  jhampanies , the yellow-paneled â€˜rickshaw and Mrs. Wessingtonâ s"
down-bowed golden head stood out clearly. She was holding her
handkerchief in her left hand and was leaning hack exhausted against
the â€˜rickshaw cushions. I turned my horse up a bypath near the Sanjowlie
Reservoir and literally ran away. Once I fancied I heard a faint call
of â Jack!â  This may have been imagination. I never stopped to verify it.
"Ten minutes later I came across Kitty on horseback; and, in the delight"
"of a long ride with her, forgot all about the interview."

"A week later Mrs. Wessington died, and the inexpressible burden of her"
existence was removed from my life. I went Plainsward perfectly happy.
"Before three months were over I had forgotten all about her, except"
that at times the discovery of some of her old letters reminded me
unpleasantly of our bygone relationship. By January I had disinterred
what was left of our correspondence from among my scattered belongings
"and had burned it. At the beginning of April of this year, 1885, I was"
"at Simla--semi-deserted Simla--once more, and was deep in loverâ s talks"
and walks with Kitty. It was decided that we should be married at the
"end of June. You will understand, therefore, that, loving Kitty as I"
"did, I am not saying too much when I pronounce myself to have been, at"
"that time, the happiest man in India."

Fourteen delightful days passed almost before I noticed their
"flight. Then, aroused to the sense of what was proper among mortals"
"circumstanced as we were, I pointed out to Kitty that an engagement ring"
was the outward and visible sign of her dignity as an engaged girl; and
that she must forthwith come to Hamiltonâ s to be measured for one. Up to
"that moment, I give you my word, we had completely forgotten so trivial"
"a matter. To Hamiltonâ s we accordingly went on the 15th of April, 1885."
Remember that--whatever my doctor may say to the contrary--I was then in
"perfect health, enjoying a well-balanced mind and an absolute tranquil"
"spirit. Kitty and I entered Hamiltonâ s shop together, and there,"
"regardless of the order of affairs, I measured Kitty for the ring in"
the presence of the amused assistant. The ring was a sapphire with two
diamonds. We then rode out down the slope that leads to the Combermere
Bridge and Pelitiâ s shop.

"While my Waler was cautiously feeling his way over the loose shale, and"
"Kitty was laughing and chattering at my side--while all Simla, that is"
"to say as much of it as had then come from the Plains, was grouped"
"round the Reading-room and Pelitiâ s veranda,--I was aware that some one,"
"apparently at a vast distance, was calling me by my Christian name. It"
"struck me that I had heard the voice before, but when and where I could"
not at once determine. In the short space it took to cover the road
between the path from Hamiltonâ s shop and the first plank of the
Combermere Bridge I had thought over half a dozen people who might have
"committed such a solecism, and had eventually decided that it must have"
been singing in my ears. Immediately opposite Pelitiâ s shop my eye was
"arrested by the sight of four  jhampanies  in â magpieâ  livery, pulling a"
"yellow-paneled, cheap, bazar â€˜rickshaw. In a moment my mind flew back to"
the previous season and Mrs. Wessington with a sense of irritation
"and disgust. Was it not enough that the woman was dead and done with,"
without her black and white servitors reappearing to spoil the dayâ s
"happiness? Whoever employed them now I thought I would call upon, and"
ask as a personal favor to change her  jhampaniesâ   livery. I would hire
"the men myself, and, if necessary, buy their coats from off their backs."
It is impossible to say here what a flood of undesirable memories their
presence evoked.

"â Kitty,â  I cried, â there are poor Mrs. Wessingtonâ s  jhampanies  turned"
up again! I wonder who has them now?â 

"Kitty had known Mrs. Wessington slightly last season, and had always"
been interested in the sickly woman.

â What? Where?â  she asked. â I canâ t see them anywhere.â 

"Even as she spoke her horse, swerving from a laden mule, threw himself"
directly in front of the advancing â€˜rickshaw. I had scarcely time to
"utter a word of warning when, to my unutterable horror, horse and rider"
passed through men and carriage as if they had been thin air.

"â Whatâ s the matter?â  cried Kitty; â what made you call out so foolishly,"
Jack? If I  am  engaged I donâ t want all creation to know about it.
"There was lots of space between the mule and the veranda; and, if you"
think I canâ t ride--There!â 

"Whereupon wilful Kitty set off, her dainty little head in the air, at a"
"hand-gallop in the direction of the Bandstand; fully expecting, as"
"she herself afterward told me, that I should follow her. What was the"
"matter? Nothing indeed. Either that I was mad or drunk, or that Simla"
"was haunted with devils. I reined in my impatient cob, and turned round."
"The â€˜rickshaw had turned too, and now stood immediately facing me, near"
the left railing of the Combermere Bridge.

"â Jack! Jack, darling!â  (There was no mistake about the words this time:"
they rang through my brain as if they had been shouted in my ear.) â Itâ s
"some hideous mistake, Iâ m sure.  Please  forgive me, Jack, and letâ s be"
friends again.â 

"The â€˜rickshaw-hood had fallen back, and inside, as I hope and pray daily"
"for the death I dread by night, sat Mrs. Keith-Wessington, handkerchief"
"in hand, and golden head bowed on her breast."

"How long I stared motionless I do not know. Finally, I was aroused by"
my syce taking the Walerâ s bridle and asking whether I was ill. From the
horrible to the commonplace is but a step. I tumbled off my horse and
"dashed, half fainting, into Pelitiâ s for a glass of cherry-brandy. There"
two or three couples were gathered round the coffee-tables discussing
the gossip of the day. Their trivialities were more comforting to me
just then than the consolations of religion could have been. I plunged
"into the midst of the conversation at once; chatted, laughed, and jested"
with a face (when I caught a glimpse of it in a mirror) as white and
"drawn as that of a corpse. Three or four men noticed my condition; and,"
"evidently setting it down to the results of over-many pegs, charitably"
endeavoured to draw me apart from the rest of the loungers. But I
refused to be led away. I wanted the company of my kind--as a child
rushes into the midst of the dinner-party after a fright in the dark.
"I must have talked for about ten minutes or so, though it seemed an"
"eternity to me, when I heard Kittyâ s clear voice outside inquiring for"
"me. In another minute she had entered the shop, prepared to roundly"
upbraid me for failing so signally in my duties. Something in my face
stopped her.

"â Why, Jack,â  she cried, â what  have  you been doing? What has happened?"
"Are you ill?â  Thus driven into a direct lie, I said that the sun had"
been a little too much for me. It was close upon five oâ clock of a
"cloudy April afternoon, and the sun had been hidden all day. I saw my"
mistake as soon as the words were out of my mouth: attempted to recover
"it; blundered hopelessly and followed Kitty in a regal rage, out of"
"doors, amid the smiles of my acquaintances. I made some excuse (I have"
forgotten what) on the score of my feeling faint; and cantered away to
"my hotel, leaving Kitty to finish the ride by herself."

In my room I sat down and tried calmly to reason out the matter. Here
"was I, Theobald Jack Pansay, a well-educated Bengal Civilian in the year"
"of grace, 1885, presumably sane, certainly healthy, driven in terror"
from my sweetheartâ s side by the apparition of a woman who had been dead
and buried eight months ago. These were facts that I could not blink.
Nothing was further from my thought than any memory of Mrs. Wessington
when Kitty and I left Hamiltonâ s shop. Nothing was more utterly
commonplace than the stretch of wall opposite Pelitiâ s. It was broad
"daylight. The road was full of people; and yet here, look you, in"
"defiance of every law of probability, in direct outrage of Natureâ s"
"ordinance, there had appeared to me a face from the grave."

Kittyâ s Arab had gone  through  the â€˜rickshaw: so that my first hope
that some woman marvelously like Mrs. Wessington had hired the carriage
and the coolies with their old livery was lost. Again and again I went
round this treadmill of thought; and again and again gave up baffled
and in despair. The voice was as inexplicable as the apparition. I had
originally some wild notion of confiding it all to Kitty; of begging her
to marry me at once; and in her arms defying the ghostly occupant of the
"â€˜rickshaw. â After all,â  I argued, â the presence of the â€˜rickshaw is in"
itself enough to prove the existence of a spectral illusion. One may see
"ghosts of men and women, but surely never of coolies and carriages. The"
whole thing is absurd. Fancy the ghost of a hillman!â 

"Next morning I sent a penitent note to Kitty, imploring her to overlook"
my strange conduct of the previous afternoon. My Divinity was still very
"wroth, and a personal apology was necessary. I explained, with a fluency"
"born of night-long pondering over a falsehood, that I had been attacked"
with sudden palpitation of the heart--the result of indigestion. This
eminently practical solution had its effect; and Kitty and I rode out
that afternoon with the shadow of my first lie dividing us.

Nothing would please her save a canter round Jakko. With my nerves still
"unstrung from the previous night I feebly protested against the notion,"
"suggesting Observatory Hill, Jutogh, the Boileaugunge road--anything"
rather than the Jakko round. Kitty was angry and a little hurt: so I
"yielded from fear of provoking further misunderstanding, and we set out"
"together toward Chota Simla. We walked a greater part of the way, and,"
"according to our custom, cantered from a mile or so below the Convent"
to the stretch of level road by the Sanjowlie Reservoir. The wretched
"horses appeared to fly, and my heart beat quicker and quicker as we"
neared the crest of the ascent. My mind had been full of Mrs. Wessington
all the afternoon; and every inch of the Jakko road bore witness to our
oldtime walks and talks. The bowlders were full of it; the pines sang it
aloud overhead; the rain-fed torrents giggled and chuckled unseen over
the shameful story; and the wind in my ears chanted the iniquity aloud.

"As a fitting climax, in the middle of the level men call the Ladiesâ "
Mile the Horror was awaiting me. No other â€˜rickshaw was in sight--only
"the four black and white  jhampanies , the yellow-paneled carriage, and"
the golden head of the woman within--all apparently just as I had left
them eight months and one fortnight ago! For an instant I fancied that
Kitty  must  see what I saw--we were so marvelously sympathetic in all
"things. Her next words undeceived me--â Not a soul in sight! Come along,"
"Jack, and Iâ ll race you to the Reservoir buildings!â  Her wiry little"
"Arab was off like a bird, my Waler following close behind, and in this"
order we dashed under the cliffs. Half a minute brought us within fifty
yards of the â€˜rickshaw. I pulled my Waler and fell back a little. The
â€˜rickshaw was directly in the middle of the road; and once more the
"Arab passed through it, my horse following. â Jack! Jack dear!  Please "
"forgive me,â  rang with a wail in my ears, and, after an interval:--â Itâ s"
"a mistake, a hideous mistake!â "

I spurred my horse like a man possessed. When I turned my head at
"the Reservoir works, the black and white liveries were still"
"waiting--patiently waiting--under the grey hillside, and the wind"
brought me a mocking echo of the words I had just heard. Kitty bantered
me a good deal on my silence throughout the remainder of the ride. I had
been talking up till then wildly and at random. To save my life I could
"not speak afterward naturally, and from Sanjowlie to the Church wisely"
held my tongue.

"I was to dine with the Mannerings that night, and had barely time to"
canter home to dress. On the road to Elysium Hill I overheard two men
"talking together in the dusk.--â Itâ s a curious thing,â  said one, â how"
completely all trace of it disappeared. You know my wife was insanely
"fond of the woman [â€˜never could see anything in her myself), and wanted"
me to pick up her old â€˜rickshaw and coolies if they were to be got for
love or money. Morbid sort of fancy I call it; but Iâ ve got to do what
the  Memsahib  tells me. Would you believe that the man she hired it
from tells me that all four of the men--they were brothers--died of
"cholera on the way to Hardwar, poor devils, and the â€˜rickshaw has been"
broken up by the man himself. â€˜Told me he never used a dead  Memsahibâ s 
"â€˜rickshaw. â€˜Spoiled his luck. Queer notion, wasnâ t it? Fancy poor little"
Mrs. Wessington spoiling any oneâ s luck except her own!â  I laughed
aloud at this point; and my laugh jarred on me as I uttered it. So there
" were  ghosts of â€˜rickshaws after all, and ghostly employments in the"
other world! How much did Mrs. Wessington give her men? What were their
hours? Where did they go?

And for visible answer to my last question I saw the infernal Thing
"blocking my path in the twilight. The dead travel fast, and by short"
cuts unknown to ordinary coolies. I laughed aloud a second time and
"checked my laughter suddenly, for I was afraid I was going mad. Mad to"
"a certain extent I must have been, for I recollect that I reined in my"
"horse at the head of the â€˜rickshaw, and politely wished Mrs. Wessington"
â Good-evening.â  Her answer was one I knew only too well. I listened
"to the end; and replied that I had heard it all before, but should"
be delighted if she had anything further to say. Some malignant devil
"stronger than I must have entered into me that evening, for I have a dim"
recollection of talking the commonplaces of the day for five minutes to
the Thing in front of me.

"â Mad as a hatter, poor devil--or drunk. Max, try and get him to come"
home.â 

Surely  that  was not Mrs. Wessingtonâ s voice! The two men had overheard
"me speaking to the empty air, and had returned to look after me. They"
"were very kind and considerate, and from their words evidently gathered"
that I was extremely drunk. I thanked them confusedly and cantered away
"to my hotel, there changed, and arrived at the Manneringsâ  ten minutes"
late. I pleaded the darkness of the night as an excuse; was rebuked by
Kitty for my unlover-like tardiness; and sat down.

"The conversation had already become general; and under cover of it, I"
was addressing some tender small talk to my sweetheart when I was aware
that at the further end of the table a short red-whiskered man was
"describing, with much broidery, his encounter with a mad unknown that"
evening.

A few sentences convinced me that he was repeating the incident of half
"an hour ago. In the middle of the story he looked round for applause, as"
"professional story-tellers do, caught my eye, and straightway collapsed."
"There was a momentâ s awkward silence, and the red-whiskered man muttered"
"something to the effect that he had â forgotten the rest,â  thereby"
sacrificing a reputation as a good story-teller which he had built
"up for six seasons past. I blessed him from the bottom of my heart,"
and--went on with my fish.

In the fulness of time that dinner came to an end; and with genuine
regret I tore myself away from Kitty--as certain as I was of my
own existence that It would be waiting for me outside the door. The
"red-whiskered man, who had been introduced to me as Doctor Heatherlegh,"
"of Simla, volunteered to bear me company as far as our roads lay"
together. I accepted his offer with gratitude.

"My instinct had not deceived me. It lay in readiness in the Mall, and,"
"in what seemed devilish mockery of our ways, with a lighted head-lamp."
"The red-whiskered man went to the point at once, in a manner that showed"
he had been thinking over it all dinner time.

"â I say, Pansay, what the deuce was the matter with you this evening on"
the Elysium road?â  The suddenness of the question wrenched an answer
from me before I was aware.

"â That!â  said I, pointing to It."

â  That  may be either D. T. or Eyes for aught I know. Now you donâ t
"liquor. I saw as much at dinner, so it canâ t be D. T. Thereâ s nothing"
"whatever where youâ re pointing, though youâ re sweating and trembling"
"with fright like a scared pony. Therefore, I conclude that itâ s Eyes."
And I ought to understand all about them. Come along home with me. Iâ m
on the Blessington lower road.â 

To my intense delight the â€˜rickshaw instead of waiting for us kept
"about twenty yards ahead--and this, too whether we walked, trotted, or"
cantered. In the course of that long night ride I had told my companion
almost as much as I have told you here.

"â Well, youâ ve spoiled one of the best tales Iâ ve ever laid tongue to,â "
"said he, â but Iâ ll forgive you for the sake of what youâ ve gone through."
"Now come home and do what I tell you; and when Iâ ve cured you,"
"young man, let this be a lesson to you to steer clear of women and"
indigestible food till the day of your death.â 

The â€˜rickshaw kept steady in front; and my red-whiskered friend seemed
to derive great pleasure from my account of its exact whereabouts.

"â Eyes, Pansay--all Eyes, Brain, and Stomach. And the greatest of these"
"three is Stomach. Youâ ve too much conceited Brain, too little Stomach,"
and thoroughly unhealthy Eyes. Get your Stomach straight and the rest
follows. And all thatâ s French for a liver pill. Iâ ll take sole medical
charge of you from this hour! for youâ re too interesting a phenomenon to
be passed over.â 

By this time we were deep in the shadow of the Blessington lower road
"and the â€˜rickshaw came to a dead stop under a pine-clad, over-hanging"
"shale cliff. Instinctively I halted too, giving my reason. Heatherlegh"
rapped out an oath.

"â Now, if you think Iâ m going to spend a cold night on the hillside"
"for the sake of a stomach- cum -Brain- cum -Eye illusion.... Lord, haâ "
mercy! Whatâ s that?â 

"There was a muffled report, a blinding smother of dust just in front"
"of us, a crack, the noise of rent boughs, and about ten yards of the"
"cliff-side--pines, undergrowth, and all--slid down into the road below,"
completely blocking it up. The uprooted trees swayed and tottered for a
"moment like drunken giants in the gloom, and then fell prone among their"
fellows with a thunderous crash. Our two horses stood motionless and
sweating with fear. As soon as the rattle of falling earth and stone had
"subsided, my companion muttered:--â Man, if weâ d gone forward we should"
have been ten feet deep in our graves by now. â€˜There are more things
"in heaven and earth.â ... Come home, Pansay, and thank God. I want a peg"
badly.â 

"We retraced our way over the Church Ridge, and I arrived at Dr."
Heatherleghâ s house shortly after midnight.

"His attempts toward my cure commenced almost immediately, and for a week"
I never left his sight. Many a time in the course of that week did I
bless the good-fortune which had thrown me in contact with Simlaâ s best
and kindest doctor. Day by day my spirits grew lighter and more equable.
"Day by day, too, I became more and more inclined to fall in with"
"Heatherleghâ s â spectral illusionâ  theory, implicating eyes, brain, and"
"stomach. I wrote to Kitty, telling her that a slight sprain caused by a"
fall from my horse kept me indoors for a few days; and that I should be
recovered before she had time to regret my absence.

Heatherleghâ s treatment was simple to a degree. It consisted of liver
"pills, cold-water baths, and strong exercise, taken in the dusk or at"
"early dawn--for, as he sagely observed: â A man with a sprained ankle"
"doesnâ t walk a dozen miles a day, and your young woman might be"
wondering if she saw you.â 

"At the end of the week, after much examination of pupil and pulse, and"
"strict injunctions as to diet and pedestrianism, Heatherlegh dismissed"
me as brusquely as he had taken charge of me. Here is his parting
"benediction: â Man, I can certify to your mental cure, and thatâ s as much"
"as to say Iâ ve cured most of your bodily ailments. Now, get your traps"
out of this as soon as you can; and be off to make love to Miss Kitty.â 

I was endeavoring to express my thanks for his kindness. He cut me
short.

â Donâ t think I did this because I like you. I gather that youâ ve behaved
"like a blackguard all through. But, all the same, youâ re a phenomenon,"
and as queer a phenomenon as you are a blackguard. No!â --checking me a
"second time--â not a rupee, please. Go out and see if you can find the"
eyes-brain-and-stomach business again. Iâ ll give you a lakh for each
time you see it.â 

Half an hour later I was in the Manneringsâ  drawing-room with
Kitty--drunk with the intoxication of present happiness and the
fore-knowledge that I should never more be troubled with Its hideous
"presence. Strong in the sense of my new-found security, I proposed a"
"ride at once; and, by preference, a canter round Jakko."

"Never had I felt so well, so overladen with vitality and mere animal"
"spirits, as I did on the afternoon of the 30th of April. Kitty was"
"delighted at the change in my appearance, and complimented me on it in"
her delightfully frank and outspoken manner. We left the Manneringsâ 
"house together, laughing and talking, and cantered along the Chota Simla"
road as of old.

I was in haste to reach the Sanjowlie Reservoir and there make my
"assurance doubly sure. The horses did their best, but seemed all too"
slow to my impatient mind. Kitty was astonished at my boisterousness.
"â Why, Jack!â  she cried at last, â you are behaving like a child. What are"
you doing?â 

"We were just below the Convent, and from sheer wantonness I was making"
my Waler plunge and curvet across the road as I tickled it with the loop
of my riding-whip.

"â Doing?â  I answered; â nothing, dear. Thatâ s just it. If youâ d been doing"
"nothing for a week except lie up, youâ d be as riotous as I.â "

"â â€˜Singing and murmuring in your feastful mirth,"
Joying to feel yourself alive;
"Lord over Nature, Lord of the visible Earth,"
Lord of the senses five.â â 

My quotation was hardly out of my lips before we had rounded the corner
above the Convent; and a few yards further on could see across to
Sanjowlie. In the centre of the level road stood the black and white
"liveries, the yellow-paneled â€˜rickshaw, and Mrs. Keith-Wessington."
"I pulled up, looked, rubbed my eyes, and, I believe must have said"
something. The next thing I knew was that I was lying face downward on
the road with Kitty kneeling above me in tears.

"â Has it gone, child!â  I gasped. Kitty only wept more bitterly."

"â Has what gone, Jack dear? what does it all mean? There must be a"
"mistake somewhere, Jack. A hideous mistake.â  Her last words brought me"
to my feet--mad--raving for the time being.

"â Yes, there is a mistake somewhere,â  I repeated, â a hideous mistake."
Come and look at It.â 

I have an indistinct idea that I dragged Kitty by the wrist along the
"road up to where It stood, and implored her for pityâ s sake to speak to"
It; to tell It that we were betrothed; that neither Death nor Hell could
break the tie between us; and Kitty only knows how much more to the
same effect. Now and again I appealed passionately to the Terror in the
"â€˜rickshaw to bear witness to all I had said, and to release me from"
a torture that was killing me. As I talked I suppose I must have told
"Kitty of my old relations with Mrs. Wessington, for I saw her listen"
intently with white face and blazing eyes.

"â Thank you, Mr. Pansay,â  she said, â thatâ s  quite  enough.  Syce ghora"
lÃ¡o. â 

"The syces, impassive as Orientals always are, had come up with the"
recaptured horses; and as Kitty sprang into her saddle I caught hold of
"the bridle, entreating her to hear me out and forgive. My answer was the"
"cut of her riding-whip across my face from mouth to eye, and a word"
"or two of farewell that even now I cannot write down. So I judged, and"
"judged rightly, that Kitty knew all; and I staggered back to the side"
"of the â€˜rickshaw. My face was cut and bleeding, and the blow of the"
riding-whip had raised a livid blue wheal on it. I had no self-respect.
"Just then, Heatherlegh, who must have been following Kitty and me at a"
"distance, cantered up."

"â Doctor,â  I said, pointing to my face, â hereâ s Miss Manneringâ s"
signature to my order of dismissal and... Iâ ll thank you for that lakh
as soon as convenient.â 

"Heatherleghâ s face, even in my abject misery, moved me to laughter."

â Iâ ll stake my professional reputationâ --he began.

"â Donâ t be a fool,â  I whispered. â Iâ ve lost my lifeâ s happiness and youâ d"
better take me home.â 

As I spoke the â€˜rickshaw was gone. Then I lost all knowledge of what was
passing. The crest of Jakko seemed to heave and roll like the crest of a
cloud and fall in upon me.

"Seven days later (on the 7th of May, that is to say) I was aware that I"
was lying in Heatherleghâ s room as weak as a little child. Heatherlegh
was watching me intently from behind the papers on his writing-table.
His first words were not encouraging; but I was too far spent to be much
moved by them.

â Hereâ s Miss Kitty has sent back your letters. You corresponded a good
"deal, you young people. Hereâ s a packet that looks like a ring, and"
"a cheerful sort of a note from Mannering Papa, which Iâ ve taken the"
liberty of reading and burning. The old gentlemanâ s not pleased with
you.â 

"â And Kitty?â  I asked, dully."

â Rather more drawn than her father from what she says. By the same token
you must have been letting out any number of queer reminiscences just
before I met you. â€˜Says that a man who would have behaved to a woman as
you did to Mrs. Wessington ought to kill himself out of sheer pity for
"his kind. Sheâ s a hot-headed little virago, your mash. â€˜Will have it"
too that you were suffering from D. T. when that row on the Jakko road
turned up. â€˜Says sheâ ll die before she ever speaks to you again.â 

I groaned and turned over to the other side.

"â Now youâ ve got your choice, my friend. This engagement has to be broken"
off; and the Mannerings donâ t want to be too hard on you. Was it broken
through D. T. or epileptic fits? Sorry I canâ t offer you a better
exchange unless youâ d prefer hereditary insanity. Say the word and Iâ ll
tell â€˜em itâ s fits. All Simla knows about that scene on the Ladiesâ 
Mile. Come! Iâ ll give you five minutes to think over it.â 

During those five minutes I believe that I explored thoroughly the
lowest circles of the Inferno which it is permitted man to tread on
earth. And at the same time I myself was watching myself faltering
"through the dark labyrinths of doubt, misery, and utter despair."
"I wondered, as Heatherlegh in his chair might have wondered, which"
dreadful alternative I should adopt. Presently I heard myself answering
"in a voice that I hardly recognized,--"

â Theyâ re confoundedly particular about morality in these parts. Give â€˜em
"fits, Heatherlegh, and my love. Now let me sleep a bit longer.â "

"Then my two selves joined, and it was only I (half crazed, devil-driven"
"I) that tossed in my bed, tracing step by step the history of the past"
month.

"â But I am in Simla,â  I kept repeating to myself. â I, Jack Pansay, am in"
Simla and there are no ghosts here. Itâ s unreasonable of that woman to
pretend there are. Why couldnâ t Agnes have left me alone? I never did
her any harm. It might just as well have been me as Agnes. Only Iâ d
never have come hack on purpose to kill  her . Why canâ t I be left
alone--left alone and happy?â 

It was high noon when I first awoke: and the sun was low in the sky
"before I slept--slept as the tortured criminal sleeps on his rack, too"
worn to feel further pain.

Next day I could not leave my bed. Heatherlegh told me in the morning
"that he had received an answer from Mr. Mannering, and that, thanks to"
"his (Heatherleghâ s) friendly offices, the story of my affliction had"
"traveled through the length and breadth of Simla, where I was on all"
sides much pitied.

"â And thatâ s rather more than you deserve,â  he concluded, pleasantly,"
â though the Lord knows youâ ve been going through a pretty severe mill.
"Never mind; weâ ll cure you yet, you perverse phenomenon.â "

"I declined firmly to be cured. â Youâ ve been much too good to me already,"
"old man,â  said I; â but I donâ t think I need trouble you further.â "

In my heart I knew that nothing Heatherlegh could do would lighten the
burden that had been laid upon me.

"With that knowledge came also a sense of hopeless, impotent rebellion"
against the unreasonableness of it all. There were scores of men no
better than I whose punishments had at least been reserved for another
"world; and I felt that it was bitterly, cruelly unfair that I alone"
should have been singled out for so hideous a fate. This mood would in
time give place to another where it seemed that the â€˜rickshaw and I were
the only realities in a world of shadows; that Kitty was a ghost; that
"Mannering, Heatherlegh, and all the other men and women I knew were all"
"ghosts; and the great, grey hills themselves but vain shadows devised"
to torture me. From mood to mood I tossed backward and forward for
"seven weary days; my body growing daily stronger and stronger, until the"
"bedroom looking-glass told me that I had returned to everyday life, and"
was as other men once more. Curiously enough my face showed no signs
"of the struggle I had gone through. It was pale indeed, but as"
expression-less and commonplace as ever. I had expected some permanent
alteration--visible evidence of the disease that was eating me away. I
found nothing.

"On the 15th of May, I left Heatherleghâ s house at eleven oâ clock in the"
morning; and the instinct of the bachelor drove me to the Club. There I
"found that every man knew my story as told by Heatherlegh, and was, in"
"clumsy fashion, abnormally kind and attentive. Nevertheless I recognized"
that for the rest of my natural life I should be among but not of my
fellows; and I envied very bitterly indeed the laughing coolies on
"the Mall below. I lunched at the Club, and at four oâ clock wandered"
aimlessly down the Mall in the vague hope of meeting Kitty. Close to
the Band-stand the black and white liveries joined me; and I heard Mrs.
Wessingtonâ s old appeal at my side. I had been expecting this ever since
I came out; and was only surprised at her delay. The phantom â€˜rickshaw
and I went side by side along the Chota Simla road in silence. Close to
"the bazar, Kitty and a man on horseback overtook and passed us. For any"
sign she gave I might have been a dog in the road. She did not even pay
me the compliment of quickening her pace; though the rainy afternoon had
served for an excuse.

"So Kitty and her companion, and I and my ghostly Light-oâ -Love, crept"
round Jakko in couples. The road was streaming with water; the pines
"dripped like roof-pipes on the rocks below, and the air was full of"
"fine, driving rain. Two or three times I found myself saying to myself"
"almost aloud: â Iâ m Jack Pansay on leave at Simla-- at Simla ! Everyday,"
ordinary Simla. I mustnâ t forget that--I mustnâ t forget that.â  Then I
would try to recollect some of the gossip I had heard at the Club: the
"prices of So-and-Soâ s horses--anything, in fact, that related to"
the workaday Anglo-Indian world I knew so well. I even repeated the
"multiplication-table rapidly to myself, to make quite sure that I was"
not taking leave of my senses. It gave me much comfort; and must have
prevented my hearing Mrs. Wessington for a time.

Once more I wearily climbed the Convent slope and entered the level
"road. Here Kitty and the man started off at a canter, and I was left"
"alone with Mrs. Wessington. â Agnes,â  said I, â will you put back your"
"hood and tell me what it all means?â  The hood dropped noiselessly, and"
I was face to face with my dead and buried mistress. She was wearing
the dress in which I had last seen her alive; carried the same tiny
handkerchief in her right hand; and the same cardcase in her left. (A
woman eight months dead with a cardcase!) I had to pin myself down to
"the multiplication-table, and to set both hands on the stone parapet of"
"the road, to assure myself that that at least was real."

"â Agnes,â  I repeated, â for pityâ s sake tell me what it all means.â  Mrs."
"Wessington leaned forward, with that odd, quick turn of the head I used"
"to know so well, and spoke."

If my story had not already so madly overleaped the bounds of all human
"belief I should apologize to you now. As I know that no one--no, not"
"even Kitty, for whom it is written as some sort of justification of"
"my conduct--will believe me, I will go on. Mrs. Wessington spoke and"
I walked with her from the Sanjowlie road to the turning below the
Commander-in-Chiefâ s house as I might walk by the side of any living
"womanâ s â€˜rickshaw, deep in conversation. The second and most tormenting"
"of my moods of sickness had suddenly laid hold upon me, and like the"
"Prince in Tennysonâ s poem, â I seemed to move amid a world of ghosts.â "
"There had been a garden-party at the Commander-in-Chiefâ s, and we two"
joined the crowd of homeward-bound folk. As I saw them then it seemed
"that  they  were the shadows--impalpable, fantastic shadows--that"
divided for Mrs. Wessingtonâ s â€˜rickshaw to pass through. What we said
"during the course of that weird interview I cannot--indeed, I dare"
not--tell. Heatherleghâ s comment would have been a short laugh and a
remark that I had been â mashing a brain-eye-and-stomach chimera.â  It was
a ghastly and yet in some indefinable way a marvelously dear experience.
"Could it be possible, I wondered, that I was in this life to woo a"
second time the woman I had killed by my own neglect and cruelty?

I met Kitty on the homeward road--a shadow among shadows.

If I were to describe all the incidents of the next fortnight in their
"order, my story would never come to an end; and your patience would be"
exhausted. Morning after morning and evening after evening the ghostly
â€˜rickshaw and I used to wander through Simla together. Wherever I went
there the four black and white liveries followed me and bore me company
to and from my hotel. At the Theatre I found them amid the crowd or
"yelling  jhampanies ; outside the Club veranda, after a long evening of"
"whist; at the Birthday Ball, waiting patiently for my reappearance; and"
"in broad daylight when I went calling. Save that it cast no shadow, the"
â€˜rickshaw was in every respect as real to look upon as one of wood and
"iron. More than once, indeed, I have had to check myself from warning"
some hard-riding friend against cantering over it. More than once I have
walked down the Mall deep in conversation with Mrs. Wessington to the
unspeakable amazement of the passers-by.

Before I had been out and about a week I learned that the â fitâ  theory
"had been discarded in favor of insanity. However, I made no change in my"
"mode of life. I called, rode, and dined out as freely as ever. I had"
a passion for the society of my kind which I had never felt before; I
hungered to be among the realities of life; and at the same time I
felt vaguely unhappy when I had been separated too long from my ghostly
companion. It would be almost impossible to describe my varying moods
from the 15th of May up to to-day.

"The presence of the â€˜rickshaw filled me by turns with horror, blind"
"fear, a dim sort of pleasure, and utter despair. I dared not leave"
"Simla; and I knew that my stay there was killing me. I knew, moreover,"
that it was my destiny to die slowly and a little every day. My only
anxiety was to get the penance over as quietly as might be. Alternately
I hungered for a sight of Kitty and watched her outrageous flirtations
"with my successor--to speak more accurately, my successors--with amused"
interest. She was as much out of my life as I was out of hers. By day I
wandered with Mrs. Wessington almost content. By night I implored Heaven
to let me return to the world as I used to know it. Above all these
"varying moods lay the sensation of dull, numbing wonder that the Seen"
and the Unseen should mingle so strangely on this earth to hound one
poor soul to its grave.

 August 27. --Heatherlegh has been indefatigable in his attendance on
me; and only yesterday told me that I ought to send in an application
for sick leave. An application to escape the company of a phantom! A
request that the Government would graciously permit me to get rid of
five ghosts and an airy â€˜rickshaw by going to England. Heatherleghâ s
proposition moved me to almost hysterical laughter. I told him that I
should await the end quietly at Simla; and I am sure that the end is not
far off. Believe me that I dread its advent more than any word can say;
and I torture myself nightly with a thousand speculations as to the
manner of my death.

Shall I die in my bed decently and as an English gentleman should die;
"or, in one last walk on the Mall, will my soul be wrenched from me to"
take its place forever and ever by the side of that ghastly phantasm?
"Shall I return to my old lost allegiance in the next world, or shall"
I meet Agnes loathing her and bound to her side through all eternity?
Shall we two hover over the scene of our lives till the end of Time?
"As the day of my death draws nearer, the intense horror that all living"
flesh feels toward escaped spirits from beyond the grave grows more and
more powerful. It is an awful thing to go down quick among the dead with
scarcely one-half of your life completed. It is a thousand times more
"awful to wait as I do in your midst, for I know not what unimaginable"
"terror. Pity me, at least on the score of my â delusion,â  for I know you"
will never believe what I have written here. Yet as surely as ever a man
was done to death by the Powers of Darkness I am that man.

"In justice, too, pity her. For as surely as ever woman was killed by"
"man, I killed Mrs. Wessington. And the last portion of my punishment is"
ever now upon me.




MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY

As I came through the Desert thus it was--
As I came through the Desert.
#NAME?

"Somewhere in the Other World, where there are books and pictures and"
"plays and shop windows to look at, and thousands of men who spend their"
"lives in building up all four, lives a gentleman who writes real stories"
about the real insides of people; and his name is Mr. Walter Besant.
But he will insist upon treating his ghosts--he has published half
a workshopful of them--with levity. He makes his ghost-seers talk
"familiarly, and, in some cases, flirt outrageously, with the phantoms."
"You may treat anything, from a Viceroy to a Vernacular Paper, with"
"levity; but you must behave reverently toward a ghost, and particularly"
an Indian one.

"There are, in this land, ghosts who take the form of fat, cold, pobby"
"corpses, and hide in trees near the roadside till a traveler passes."
Then they drop upon his neck and remain. There are also terrible ghosts
of women who have died in child-bed. These wander along the pathways at
"dusk, or hide in the crops near a village, and call seductively. But to"
answer their call is death in this world and the next. Their feet are
turned backward that all sober men may recognize them. There are ghosts
of little children who have been thrown into wells. These haunt well
"curbs and the fringes of jungles, and wail under the stars, or catch"
women by the wrist and beg to be taken up and carried. These and the
"corpse ghosts, however, are only vernacular articles and do not attack"
Sahibs. No native ghost has yet been authentically reported to have
frightened an Englishman; but many English ghosts have scared the life
out of both white and black.

Nearly every other Station owns a ghost. There are said to be two
"at Simla, not counting the woman who blows the bellows at Syree"
dÃ¢k-bungalow on the Old Road; Mussoorie has a house haunted of a very
lively Thing; a White Lady is supposed to do night-watchman round a
house in Lahore; Dalhousie says that one of her houses â repeatsâ  on
autumn evenings all the incidents of a horrible horse-and-precipice
"accident; Murree has a merry ghost, and, now that she has been swept"
"by cholera, will have room for a sorrowful one; there are Officersâ "
"Quarters in Mian Mir whose doors open without reason, and whose"
"furniture is guaranteed to creak, not with the heat of June but with"
the weight of Invisibles who come to lounge in the chairs; Peshawur
possesses houses that none will willingly rent; and there is
something--not fever--wrong with a big bungalow in Allahabad. The older
"Provinces simply bristle with haunted houses, and march phantom armies"
along their main thoroughfares.

Some of the dÃ¢k-bungalows on the Grand Trunk Road have handy little
cemeteries in their compound--witnesses to the â changes and chances
of this mortal lifeâ  in the days when men drove from Calcutta to the
Northwest. These bungalows are objectionable places to put up in.
"They are generally very old, always dirty, while the  khansamah  is as"
"ancient as the bungalow. He either chatters senilely, or falls into the"
long trances of age. In both moods he is useless. If you get angry with
"him, he refers to some Sahib dead and buried these thirty years, and"
says that when he was in that Sahibâ s service not a  khansamah  in the
Province could touch him. Then he jabbers and mows and trembles and
"fidgets among the dishes, and you repent of your irritation."

"In these dÃ¢k-bungalows, ghosts are most likely to be found, and when"
"found, they should be made a note of. Not long ago it was my business to"
live in dÃ¢k-bungalows. I never inhabited the same house for three
"nights running, and grew to be learned in the breed. I lived in"
"Government-built ones with red brick walls and rail ceilings, an"
"inventory of the furniture posted in every room, and an excited snake at"
the threshold to give welcome. I lived in â convertedâ  ones--old houses
officiating as dÃ¢k-bungalows--where nothing was in its proper place
and there wasnâ t even a fowl for dinner. I lived in second-hand
palaces where the wind blew through open-work marble tracery just as
uncomfortably as through a broken pane. I lived in dÃ¢k-bungalows where
"the last entry in the visitorsâ  book was fifteen months old, and where"
they slashed off the curry-kidâ s head with a sword. It was my good
"luck to meet all sorts of men, from sober traveling missionaries and"
"deserters flying from British Regiments, to drunken loafers who threw"
whisky bottles at all who passed; and my still greater good fortune just
to escape a maternity case. Seeing that a fair proportion of the tragedy
"of our lives out here acted itself in dÃ¢k-bungalows, I wondered that"
I had met no ghosts. A ghost that would voluntarily hang about a
dÃ¢k-bungalow would be mad of course; but so many men have died mad in
dÃ¢k-bungalows that there must be a fair percentage of lunatic ghosts.

"In due time I found my ghost, or ghosts rather, for there were two of"
them. Up till that hour I had sympathized with Mr. Besantâ s method of
"handling them, as shown in â The Strange Case of Mr. Lucraft and Other"
Stories.â  I am now in the Opposition.

We will call the bungalow Katmal dÃ¢k-bungalow. But THAT was the smallest
part of the horror. A man with a sensitive hide has no right to sleep in
dÃ¢k-bungalows. He should marry. Katmal dÃ¢k-bungalow was old and rotten
"and unrepaired. The floor was of worn brick, the walls were filthy, and"
the windows were nearly black with grime. It stood on a bypath largely
"used by native Sub-Deputy Assistants of all kinds, from Finance to"
"Forests; but real Sahibs were rare. The  khansamah , who was nearly bent"
"double with old age, said so."

"When I arrived, there was a fitful, undecided rain on the face of the"
"land, accompanied by a restless wind, and every gust made a noise"
like the rattling of dry bones in the stiff toddy palms outside. The
 khansamah  completely lost his head on my arrival. He had served a
Sahib once. Did I know that Sahib? He gave me the name of a well-known
"man who has been buried for more than a quarter of a century, and showed"
me an ancient daguerreotype of that man in his prehistoric youth. I had
seen a steel engraving of him at the head of a double volume of Memoirs
"a month before, and I felt ancient beyond telling."

The day shut in and the  khansamah  went to get me food. He did not go
through the pretense of calling it â  khana â --manâ s victuals. He said
"â  ratub ,â  and that means, among other things, â grubâ --dogâ s rations."
There was no insult in his choice of the term. He had forgotten the
"other word, I suppose."

"While he was cutting up the dead bodies of animals, I settled myself"
"down, after exploring the dÃ¢k-bungalow. There were three rooms, beside"
"my own, which was a corner kennel, each giving into the other through"
dingy white doors fastened with long iron bars. The bungalow was a very
"solid one, but the partition walls of the rooms were almost jerry-built"
in their flimsiness. Every step or bang of a trunk echoed from my room
"down the other three, and every footfall came back tremulously from the"
far walls. For this reason I shut the door. There were no lamps--only
candles in long glass shades. An oil wick was set in the bathroom.

"For bleak, unadulterated misery that dÃ¢k-bungalow was the worst of"
"the many that I had ever set foot in. There was no fireplace, and"
the windows would not open; so a brazier of charcoal would have been
useless. The rain and the wind splashed and gurgled and moaned round the
"house, and the toddy palms rattled and roared. Half a dozen jackals"
"went through the compound singing, and a hyena stood afar off and mocked"
them. A hyena would convince a Sadducee of the Resurrection of the
"Dead--the worst sort of Dead. Then came the  ratub --a curious meal,"
half native and half English in composition--with the old  khansamah 
"babbling behind my chair about dead and gone English people, and"
the wind-blown candles playing shadow-bo-peep with the bed and the
mosquito-curtains. It was just the sort of dinner and evening to make
"a man think of every single one of his past sins, and of all the others"
that he intended to commit if he lived.

"Sleep, for several hundred reasons, was not easy. The lamp in the"
"bath-room threw the most absurd shadows into the room, and the wind was"
beginning to talk nonsense.

Just when the reasons were drowsy with blood-sucking I heard the
regular--â Let-us-take-and-heave-him-overâ  grunt of doolie-bearers in the
"compound. First one doolie came in, then a second, and then a third. I"
"heard the doolies dumped on the ground, and the shutter in front of"
"my door shook. â Thatâ s some one trying to come in,â  I said. But no one"
"spoke, and I persuaded myself that it was the gusty wind. The shutter"
"of the room next to mine was attacked, flung back, and the inner door"
"opened. â Thatâ s some Sub-Deputy Assistant,â  I said, â and he has brought"
his friends with him. Now theyâ ll talk and spit and smoke for an hour.â 

But there were no voices and no footsteps. No one was putting his
"luggage into the next room. The door shut, and I thanked Providence that"
I was to be left in peace. But I was curious to know where the doolies
had gone. I got out of bed and looked into the darkness. There was never
"a sign of a doolie. Just as I was getting into bed again, I heard,"
"in the next room, the sound that no man in his senses can possibly"
mistake--the whir of a billiard ball down the length of the slates when
the striker is stringing for break. No other sound is like it. A
"minute afterwards there was another whir, and I got into bed. I was not"
frightened--indeed I was not. I was very curious to know what had become
of the doolies. I jumped into bed for that reason.

Next minute I heard the double click of a cannon and my hair sat up. It
is a mistake to say that hair stands up. The skin of the head tightens
"and you can feel a faint, prickly, bristling all over the scalp. That is"
the hair sitting up.

"There was a whir and a click, and both sounds could only have been made"
by one thing--a billiard ball. I argued the matter out at great length
with myself; and the more I argued the less probable it seemed that one
"bed, one table, and two chairs--all the furniture of the room next to"
mine--could so exactly duplicate the sounds of a game of billiards.
"After another cannon, a three-cushion one to judge by the whir, I"
argued no more. I had found my ghost and would have given worlds to have
"escaped from that dÃ¢k-bungalow. I listened, and with each listen the"
game grew clearer. There was whir on whir and click on click. Sometimes
there was a double click and a whir and another click. Beyond any sort
"of doubt, people were playing billiards in the next room. And the next"
room was not big enough to hold a billiard table!

Between the pauses of the wind I heard the game go forward--stroke
after stroke. I tried to believe that I could not hear voices; but that
attempt was a failure.

"Do you know what fear is? Not ordinary fear of insult, injury or death,"
"but abject, quivering dread of something that you cannot see--fear that"
dries the inside of the mouth and half of the throat--fear that makes
"you sweat on the palms of the hands, and gulp in order to keep the uvula"
"at work? This is a fine Fear--a great cowardice, and must be felt to"
be appreciated. The very improbability of billiards in a dÃ¢k-bungalow
proved the reality of the thing. No man--drunk or sober--could imagine a
"game at billiards, or invent the spitting crack of a â screw-cannon.â "

A severe course of dÃ¢k-bungalows has this disadvantage--it
breeds infinite credulity. If a man said to a confirmed
"dÃ¢k-bungalow-haunter:--â There is a corpse in the next room, and thereâ s"
"a mad girl in the next but one, and the woman and man on that camel"
"have just eloped from a place sixty miles away,â  the hearer would not"
"disbelieve because he would know that nothing is too wild, grotesque, or"
horrible to happen in a dÃ¢k-bungalow.

"This credulity, unfortunately, extends to ghosts. A rational person"
fresh from his own house would have turned on his side and slept. I
did not. So surely as I was given up as a bad carcass by the scores
"of things in the bed because the bulk of my blood was in my heart, so"
surely did I hear every stroke of a long game at billiards played in the
echoing room behind the iron-barred door. My dominant fear was that the
players might want a marker. It was an absurd fear; because creatures
who could play in the dark would be above such superfluities. I only
know that that was my terror; and it was real.

"After a long, long while the game stopped, and the door banged. I slept"
because I was dead tired. Otherwise I should have preferred to have kept
awake. Not for everything in Asia would I have dropped the door-bar and
peered into the dark of the next room.

"When the morning came, I considered that I had done well and wisely, and"
inquired for the means of departure.

"â By the way,  khansamah ,â  I said, â what were those three doolies doing"
in my compound in the night?â 

"â There were no doolies,â  said the  khansamah ."

I went into the next room and the daylight streamed through the open
"door. I was immensely brave. I would, at that hour, have played Black"
Pool with the owner of the big Black Pool down below.

â Has this place always been a dÃ¢k-bungalow?â  I asked.

"â No,â  said the  khansamah . â Ten or twenty years ago, I have forgotten"
"how long, it was a billiard room.â "

â A how much?â 

â A billiard room for the Sahibs who built the Railway. I was  khansamah 
"then in the big house where all the Railway-Sahibs lived, and I used"
"to come across with brandy- shrab . These three rooms were all one, and"
they held a big table on which the Sahibs played every evening. But
"the Sahibs are all dead now, and the Railway runs, you say, nearly to"
Kabul.â 

â Do you remember anything about the Sahibs?â 

"â It is long ago, but I remember that one Sahib, a fat man and always"
"angry, was playing here one night, and he said to me:--â€˜Mangal Khan,"
"brandy- pani do ,â  and I filled the glass, and he bent over the table to"
"strike, and his head fell lower and lower till it hit the table, and his"
"spectacles came off, and when we--the Sahibs and I myself--ran to lift"
"him. He was dead. I helped to carry him out. Aha, he was a strong Sahib!"
"But he is dead and I, old Mangal Khan, am still living, by your favor.â "

"That was more than enough! I had my ghost--a firsthand, authenticated"
article. I would write to the Society for Psychical Research--I would
"paralyze the Empire with the news! But I would, first of all, put eighty"
miles of assessed crop land between myself and that dÃ¢k-bungalow before
nightfall. The Society might send their regular agent to investigate
later on.

I went into my own room and prepared to pack after noting down the facts
"of the case. As I smoked I heard the game begin again,--with a miss in"
"balk this time, for the whir was a short one."

The door was open and I could see into the room.  Click--click!  That
"was a cannon. I entered the room without fear, for there was sunlight"
within and a fresh breeze without. The unseen game was going on at
"a tremendous rate. And well it might, when a restless little rat was"
"running to and fro inside the dingy ceiling-cloth, and a piece of loose"
window-sash was making fifty breaks off the window-bolt as it shook in
the breeze!

Impossible to mistake the sound of billiard balls! Impossible to mistake
the whir of a ball over the slate! But I was to be excused. Even when I
shut my enlightened eyes the sound was marvelously like that of a fast
game.

"Entered angrily the faithful partner of my sorrows, Kadir Baksh."

â This bungalow is very bad and low-caste! No wonder the Presence was
disturbed and is speckled. Three sets of doolie-bearers came to the
"bungalow late last night when I was sleeping outside, and said that it"
was their custom to rest in the rooms set apart for the English people!
"What honor has the  khansamah ? They tried to enter, but I told them to"
"go. No wonder, if these  Oorias  have been here, that the Presence is"
"sorely spotted. It is shame, and the work of a dirty man!â "

Kadir Baksh did not say that he had taken from each gang two annas for
"rent in advance, and then, beyond my earshot, had beaten them with the"
big green umbrella whose use I could never before divine. But Kadir
Baksh has no notions of morality.

"There was an interview with the  khansamah , but as he promptly lost his"
"head, wrath gave place to pity, and pity led to a long conversation,"
in the course of which he put the fat Engineer-Sahibâ s tragic death in
three separate stations--two of them fifty miles away. The third shift
"was to Calcutta, and there the Sahib died while driving a dogcart."

If I had encouraged him the  khansamah  would have wandered all through
Bengal with his corpse.

"I did not go away as soon as I intended. I stayed for the night, while"
the wind and the rat and the sash and the window-bolt played a ding-dong
"â hundred and fifty up.â  Then the wind ran out and the billiards stopped,"
"and I felt that I had ruined my one genuine, hall-marked ghost story."

"Had I only stopped at the proper time, I could have made  anything  out"
of it.

That was the bitterest thought of all!




THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES

Alive or dead--there is no other way.
#NAME?

"There is, as the conjurers say, no deception about this tale. Jukes by"
"accident stumbled upon a village that is well known to exist, though"
he is the only Englishman who has been there. A somewhat similar
"institution used to flourish on the outskirts of Calcutta, and there is"
"a story that if you go into the heart of Bikanir, which is in the heart"
"of the Great Indian Desert, you shall come across not a village but a"
town where the Dead who did not die but may not live have established
"their headquarters. And, since it is perfectly true that in the same"
Desert is a wonderful city where all the rich money lenders retreat
after they have made their fortunes (fortunes so vast that the owners
"cannot trust even the strong hand of the Government to protect them,"
"but take refuge in the waterless sands), and drive sumptuous C-spring"
"barouches, and buy beautiful girls and decorate their palaces with gold"
"and ivory and Minton tiles and mother-nâ -pearl, I do not see why Jukesâ s"
"tale should not be true. He is a Civil Engineer, with a head for plans"
"and distances and things of that kind, and he certainly would not take"
the trouble to invent imaginary traps. He could earn more by doing his
"legitimate work. He never varies the tale in the telling, and grows"
very hot and indignant when he thinks of the disrespectful treatment
"he received. He wrote this quite straightforwardly at first, but he has"
"since touched it up in places and introduced Moral Reflections, thus:"

In the beginning it all arose from a slight attack of fever. My work
necessitated my being in camp for some months between Pakpattan and
Muharakpur--a desolate sandy stretch of country as every one who has had
the misfortune to go there may know. My coolies were neither more nor
"less exasperating than other gangs, and my work demanded sufficient"
"attention to keep me from moping, had I been inclined to so unmanly a"
weakness.

"On the 23d December, 1884, I felt a little feverish. There was a full"
"moon at the time, and, in consequence, every dog near my tent was baying"
it. The brutes assembled in twos and threes and drove me frantic. A few
days previously I had shot one loud-mouthed singer and suspended his
carcass  in terrorem  about fifty yards from my tent-door. But his
"friends fell upon, fought for, and ultimately devoured the body; and, as"
"it seemed to me, sang their hymns of thanksgiving afterward with renewed"
energy.

The light-heartedness which accompanies fever acts differently on
"different men. My irritation gave way, after a short time, to a fixed"
determination to slaughter one huge black and white beast who had been
foremost in song and first in flight throughout the evening. Thanks to
a shaking hand and a giddy head I had already missed him twice with both
"barrels of my shot-gun, when it struck me that my best plan would be to"
"ride him down in the open and finish him off with a hog-spear. This, of"
"course, was merely the semi-delirious notion of a fever patient; but I"
remember that it struck me at the time as being eminently practical and
feasible.

I therefore ordered my groom to saddle Pornic and bring him round
"quietly to the rear of my tent. When the pony was ready, I stood at his"
head prepared to mount and dash out as soon as the dog should again lift
"up his voice. Pornic, by the way, had not been out of his pickets for a"
couple of days; the night air was crisp and chilly; and I was armed
with a specially long and sharp pair of persuaders with which I had been
"rousing a sluggish cob that afternoon. You will easily believe, then,"
"that when he was let go he went quickly. In one moment, for the brute"
"bolted as straight as a die, the tent was left far behind, and we were"
flying over the smooth sandy soil at racing speed.

"In another we had passed the wretched dog, and I had almost forgotten"
why it was that I had taken the horse and hogspear.

The delirium of fever and the excitement of rapid motion through the
air must have taken away the remnant of my senses. I have a faint
"recollection of standing upright in my stirrups, and of brandishing my"
hog-spear at the great white Moon that looked down so calmly on my mad
gallop; and of shout-log challenges to the camel-thorn bushes as they
"whizzed past. Once or twice I believe, I swayed forward on Pornicâ s"
"neck, and literally hung on by my spurs--as the marks next morning"
showed.

"The wretched beast went forward like a thing possessed, over what seemed"
"to be a limitless expanse of moonlit sand. Next, I remember, the ground"
"rose suddenly in front of us, and as we topped the ascent I saw the"
waters of the Sutlej shining like a silver bar below. Then Pornic
"blundered heavily on his nose, and we rolled together down some unseen"
slope.

"I must have lost consciousness, for when I recovered I was lying on"
"my stomach in a heap of soft white sand, and the dawn was beginning to"
break dimly over the edge of the slope down which I had fallen. As the
light grew stronger I saw that I was at the bottom of a horseshoe-shaped
"crater of sand, opening on one side directly on to the shoals of the"
"Sutlej. My fever had altogether left me, and, with the exception of a"
"slight dizziness in the head, I felt no had effects from the fall over"
night.

"Pornic, who was standing a few yards away, was naturally a good deal"
"exhausted, but had not hurt himself in the least. His saddle, a favorite"
"polo one was much knocked about, and had been twisted under his belly."
"It took me some time to put him to rights, and in the meantime I had"
ample opportunities of observing the spot into which I had so foolishly
dropped.

"At the risk of being considered tedious, I must describe it at length:"
inasmuch as an accurate mental picture of its peculiarities will be of
material assistance in enabling the reader to understand what follows.

"Imagine then, as I have said before, a horseshoe-shaped crater of sand"
"with steeply graded sand walls about thirty-five feet high. (The slope,"
"I fancy, must have been about 65 degrees.) This crater enclosed a level"
"piece of ground about fifty yards long by thirty at its broadest part,"
"with a crude well in the centre. Round the bottom of the crater,"
"about three feet from the level of the ground proper, ran a series of"
"eighty-three semi-circular ovoid, square, and multilateral holes, all"
about three feet at the mouth. Each hole on inspection showed that it
"was carefully shored internally with drift-wood and bamboos, and over"
"the mouth a wooden drip-board projected, like the peak of a jockeyâ s"
"cap, for two feet. No sign of life was visible in these tunnels, but a"
most sickening stench pervaded the entire amphitheatre--a stench fouler
than any which my wanderings in Indian villages have introduced me to.

"Having remounted Pornic, who was as anxious as I to get back to camp, I"
rode round the base of the horseshoe to find some place whence an exit
"would be practicable. The inhabitants, whoever they might be, had not"
"thought fit to put in an appearance, so I was left to my own devices. My"
first attempt to â rushâ  Pornic up the steep sand-banks showed me that
I had fallen into a trap exactly on the same model as that which the
ant-lion sets for its prey. At each step the shifting sand poured down
"from above in tons, and rattled on the drip-boards of the holes like"
small shot. A couple of ineffectual charges sent us both rolling down to
"the bottom, half choked with the torrents of sand; and I was constrained"
to turn my attention to the river-bank.

Here everything seemed easy enough. The sand hills ran down to the river
"edge, it is true, but there were plenty of shoals and shallows across"
"which I could gallop Pornic, and find my way back to  terra firma  by"
turning sharply to the right or left. As I led Pornic over the sands I
was startled by the faint pop of a rifle across the river; and at the
same moment a bullet dropped with a sharp â  whit â  close to Pornicâ s
head.

There was no mistaking the nature of the missile--a regulation
Martini-Henry â picket.â  About five hundred yards away a country-boat was
anchored in midstream; and a jet of smoke drifting away from its bows in
the still morning air showed me whence the delicate attention had come.
Was ever a respectable gentleman in such an  impasse ? The treacherous
sand slope allowed no escape from a spot which I had visited most
"involuntarily, and a promenade on the river frontage was the signal for"
a bombardment from some insane native in a boat. Iâ m afraid that I lost
my temper very much indeed.

Another bullet reminded me that I had better save my breath to cool
my porridge; and I retreated hastily up the sands and back to the
"horseshoe, where I saw that the noise of the rifle had drawn sixty-five"
human beings from the badger-holes which I had up till that point
supposed to be untenanted. I found myself in the midst of a crowd of
"spectators--about forty men, twenty women, and one child who could not"
have been more than five years old. They were all scantily clothed in
"that salmon-colored cloth which one associates with Hindu mendicants,"
"and, at first sight, gave me the impression of a band of loathsome"
 fakirs . The filth and repulsiveness of the assembly were beyond
"all description, and I shuddered to think what their life in the"
badger-holes must be.

"Even in these days, when local self-government has destroyed the greater"
"part of a nativeâ s respect for a Sahib, I have been accustomed to a"
"certain amount of civility from my inferiors, and on approaching the"
crowd naturally expected that there would be some recognition of my
presence. As a matter of fact there was; but it was by no means what I
had looked for.

The ragged crew actually laughed at me--such laughter I hope I may never
"hear again. They cackled, yelled, whistled, and howled as I walked into"
their midst; some of them literally throwing themselves down on the
ground in convulsions of unholy mirth. In a moment I had let go Pornicâ s
"head, and, irritated beyond expression at the morningâ s adventure,"
commenced cuffing those nearest to me with all the force I could. The
"wretches dropped under my blows like nine-pins, and the laughter gave"
place to wails for mercy; while those yet untouched clasped me round the
"knees, imploring me in all sorts of uncouth tongues to spare them."

"In the tumult, and just when I was feeling very much ashamed of myself"
"for having thus easily given way to my temper, a thin, high voice"
murmured in English from behind my shoulder: â Sahib! Sahib! Do you not
"know me? Sahib, it is Gunga Dass, the telegraph-master.â "

I spun round quickly and faced the speaker.

"Gunga Dass, (I have, of course, no hesitation in mentioning the manâ s"
real name) I had known four years before as a Deccanee Brahmin loaned by
the Punjab Government to one of the Khalsia States. He was in charge
"of a branch telegraph-office there, and when I had last met him was"
"a jovial, full-stomached, portly Government servant with a marvelous"
capacity for making bad puns in English--a peculiarity which made
me remember him long after I had forgotten his services to me in his
official capacity. It is seldom that a Hindu makes English puns.

"Now, however, the man was changed beyond all recognition. Caste-mark,"
"stomach, slate-colored continuations, and unctuous speech were all gone."
"I looked at a withered skeleton, turban-less and almost naked, with long"
matted hair and deep-set codfish-eyes. But for a crescent-shaped scar on
the left cheek--the result of an accident for which I was responsible I
"should never have known him. But it was indubitably Gunga Dass, and--for"
this I was thankfull--an English-speaking native who might at least tell
me the meaning of all that I had gone through that day.

The crowd retreated to some distance as I turned toward the miserable
"figure, and ordered him to show me some method of escaping from the"
"crater. He held a freshly plucked crow in his hand, and in reply to my"
question climbed slowly on a platform of sand which ran in front of
"the holes, and commenced lighting a fire there in silence. Dried bents,"
"sand-poppies, and driftwood burn quickly; and I derived much consolation"
from the fact that he lit them with an ordinary sulphur-match. When they
"were in a bright glow, and the crow was nearly spitted in front thereof,"
Gunga Dass began without a word of preamble:

"â There are only two kinds of men, Sar. The alive and the dead. When you"
"are dead you are dead, but when you are alive you live.â  (Here the crow"
demanded his attention for an instant as it twirled before the fire in
danger of being burned to a cinder.) â If you die at home and do not die
when you come to the ghÃ¢t to be burned you come here.â 

"The nature of the reeking village was made plain now, and all that I had"
known or read of the grotesque and the horrible paled before the fact
"just communicated by the ex-Brahmin. Sixteen years ago, when I first"
"landed in Bombay, I had been told by a wandering Armenian of the"
"existence, somewhere in India, of a place to which such Hindus as had"
the misfortune to recover from trance or catalepsy were conveyed and
"kept, and I recollect laughing heartily at what I was then pleased to"
consider a travelerâ s tale.

"Sitting at the bottom of the sand-trap, the memory of Watsonâ s Hotel,"
"with its swinging punkahs, white-robed attendants, and the sallow-faced"
"Armenian, rose up in my mind as vividly as a photograph, and I burst"
into a loud fit of laughter. The contrast was too absurd!

"Gunga Dass, as he bent over the unclean bird, watched me curiously."
"Hindus seldom laugh, and his surroundings were not such as to move Gunga"
Dass to any undue excess of hilarity. He removed the crow solemnly
from the wooden spit and as solemnly devoured it. Then he continued his
"story, which I give in his own words:"

â In epidemics of the cholera you are carried to be burned almost before
"you are dead. When you come to the riverside the cold air, perhaps,"
"makes you alive, and then, if you are only little alive, mud is put on"
your nose and mouth and you die conclusively. If you are rather more
"alive, more mud is put; but if you are too lively they let you go"
"and take you away. I was too lively, and made protestation with anger"
against the indignities that they endeavored to press upon me. In those
days I was Brahmin and proud man. Now I am dead man and eatâ --here he
eyed the well-gnawed breast bone with the first sign of emotion that
"I had seen in him since we met--â crows, and other things. They took me"
from my sheets when they saw that I was too lively and gave me medicines
"for one week, and I survived successfully. Then they sent me by rail"
"from my place to Okara Station, with a man to take care of me; and"
"at Okara Station we met two other men, and they conducted we three"
"on camels, in the night, from Okara Station to this place, and they"
"propelled me from the top to the bottom, and the other two succeeded,"
and I have been here ever since two and a half years. Once I was Brahmin
"and proud man, and now I eat crows.â "

â There is no way of getting out?â 

â None of what kind at all. When I first came I made experiments
"frequently and all the others also, but we have always succumbed to the"
sand which is precipitated upon our heads.â 

"â But surely,â  I broke in at this point, â the river-front is open, and"
it is worth while dodging the bullets; while at nightâ --I had already
matured a rough plan of escape which a natural instinct of selfishness
"forbade me sharing with Gunga Dass. He, however, divined my"
"unspoken thought almost as soon as it was formed; and, to my intense"
"astonishment, gave vent to a long low chuckle of derision--the laughter,"
"be it understood, of a superior or at least of an equal."

â You will notâ --he had dropped the Sir completely after his opening
sentence--â make any escape that way. But you can try. I have tried. Once
only.â 

The sensation of nameless terror and abject fear which I had in vain
attempted to strive against overmastered me completely. My long fast--it
"was now close upon ten oâ clock, and I had eaten nothing since tiffin on"
the previous day--combined with the violent and unnatural agitation of
"the ride had exhausted me, and I verily believe that, for a few minutes,"
I acted as one mad. I hurled myself against the pitiless sand-slope I
"ran round the base of the crater, blaspheming and praying by turns. I"
"crawled out among the sedges of the river-front, only to be driven back"
each time in an agony of nervous dread by the rifle-bullets which cut
up the sand round me--for I dared not face the death of a mad dog among
"that hideous crowd--and finally fell, spent and raving, at the curb of"
the well. No one had taken the slightest notion of an exhibition which
makes me blush hotly even when I think of it now.

"Two or three men trod on my panting body as they drew water, but they"
"were evidently used to this sort of thing, and had no time to waste"
"upon me. The situation was humiliating. Gunga Dass, indeed, when he had"
"banked the embers of his fire with sand, was at some pains to throw half"
"a cupful of fetid water over my head, an attention for which I could"
"have fallen on my knees and thanked him, but he was laughing all the"
"while in the same mirthless, wheezy key that greeted me on my first"
"attempt to force the shoals. And so, in a semi-comatose condition, I"
"lay till noon. Then, being only a man after all, I felt hungry, and"
"intimated as much to Gunga Dass, whom I had begun to regard as my"
natural protector. Following the impulse of the outer world when dealing
"with natives, I put my hand into my pocket and drew out four annas. The"
"absurdity of the gift struck me at once, and I was about to replace the"
money.

"Gunga Dass, however, was of a different opinion. â Give me the money,â "
"said he; â all you have, or I will get help, and we will kill you!â  All"
this as if it were the most natural thing in the world!

"A Britonâ s first impulse, I believe, is to guard the contents of his"
pockets; but a momentâ s reflection convinced me of the futility
of differing with the one man who had it in his power to make me
comfortable; and with whose help it was possible that I might eventually
"escape from the crater. I gave him all the money in my possession, Rs."
9-8-5--nine rupees eight annas and five pie--for I always keep small
"change as bakshish when I am in camp. Gunga Dass clutched the coins, and"
"hid them at once in his ragged loin cloth, his expression changing to"
something diabolical as he looked round to assure himself that no one
had observed us.

"â  Now  I will give you something to eat,â  said he."

What pleasure the possession of my money could have afforded him I am
unable to say; but inasmuch as it did give him evident delight I was not
"sorry that I had parted with it so readily, for I had no doubt that he"
would have had me killed if I had refused. One does not protest against
the vagaries of a den of wild beasts; and my companions were lower than
"any beasts. While I devoured what Gunga Dass had provided, a coarse"
" chapatti  and a cupful of the foul well-water, the people showed not"
"the faintest sign of curiosity--that curiosity which is so rampant, as a"
"rule, in an Indian village."

I could even fancy that they despised me. At all events they treated me
"with the most chilling indifference, and Gunga Dass was nearly as bad."
"I plied him with questions about the terrible village, and received"
"extremely unsatisfactory answers. So far as I could gather, it had been"
in existence from time immemorial--whence I concluded that it was at
least a century old--and during that time no one had ever been known to
"escape from it. [I had to control myself here with both hands, lest the"
blind terror should lay hold of me a second time and drive me raving
round the crater.] Gunga Dass took a malicious pleasure in emphasizing
this point and in watching me wince. Nothing that I could do would
induce him to tell me who the mysterious â Theyâ  were.

"â It is so ordered,â  he would reply, â and I do not yet know any one who"
has disobeyed the orders.â 

"â Only wait till my servants find that I am missing,â  I retorted, â and I"
"promise you that this place shall be cleared off the face of the earth,"
"and Iâ ll give you a lesson in civility, too, my friend.â "

â Your servants would be torn in pieces before they came near this place;
"and, besides, you are dead, my dear friend. It is not your fault, of"
"course, but none the less you are dead and buried.â "

"At irregular intervals supplies of food, I was told, were dropped down"
"from the land side into the amphitheatre, and the inhabitants fought for"
them like wild beasts. When a man felt his death coming on he retreated
to his lair and died there. The body was sometimes dragged out of the
"hole and thrown on to the sand, or allowed to rot where it lay."

"The phrase â thrown on to the sandâ  caught my attention, and I asked"
Gunga Dass whether this sort of thing was not likely to breed a
pestilence.

"â That,â  said he with another of his wheezy chuckles, â you may see for"
yourself subsequently. You will have much time to make observations.â 

"Whereat, to his great delight, I winced once more and hastily continued"
the conversation: â And how do you live here from day to day? What do you
do?â  The question elicited exactly the same answer as before--coupled
with the information that â this place is like your European heaven;
there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage.â 

"Gunga Dass had been educated at a Mission School, and, as he himself"
"admitted, had he only changed his religion â like a wise man,â  might have"
avoided the living grave which was now his portion. But as long as I was
with him I fancy he was happy.

"Here was a Sahib, a representative of the dominant race, helpless as"
a child and completely at the mercy of his native neighbors. In a
deliberate lazy way he set himself to torture me as a schoolboy would
devote a rapturous half-hour to watching the agonies of an impaled
"beetle, or as a ferret in a blind burrow might glue himself comfortably"
to the neck of a rabbit. The burden of his conversation was that there
"was no escape â of no kind whatever,â  and that I should stay here till I"
died and was â thrown on to the sand.â  If it were possible to forejudge
the conversation of the Damned on the advent of a new soul in their
"abode, I should say that they would speak as Gunga Dass did to me"
throughout that long afternoon. I was powerless to protest or answer;
all my energies being devoted to a struggle against the inexplicable
terror that threatened to overwhelm me again and again. I can compare
the feeling to nothing except the struggles of a man against the
overpowering nausea of the Channel passage--only my agony was of the
spirit and infinitely more terrible.

"As the day wore on, the inhabitants began to appear in full strength to"
"catch the rays of the afternoon sun, which were now sloping in at the"
"mouth of the crater. They assembled in little knots, and talked among"
themselves without even throwing a glance in my direction. About four
"oâ clock, as far as I could judge Gunga Dass rose and dived into his lair"
"for a moment, emerging with a live crow in his hands. The wretched bird"
"was in a most draggled and deplorable condition, but seemed to be in no"
"way afraid of its master. Advancing cautiously to the river front, Gunga"
Dass stepped from tussock to tussock until he had reached a smooth patch
of sand directly in the line of the boatâ s fire. The occupants of the
"boat took no notice. Here he stopped, and, with a couple of dexterous"
"turns of the wrist, pegged the bird on its back with outstretched wings."
"As was only natural, the crow began to shriek at once and beat the air"
with its claws. In a few seconds the clamor had attracted the attention
"of a bevy of wild crows on a shoal a few hundred yards away, where they"
were discussing something that looked like a corpse. Half a dozen crows
"flew over at once to see what was going on, and also, as it proved, to"
"attack the pinioned bird. Gunga Dass, who had lain down on a tussock,"
"motioned to me to be quiet, though I fancy this was a needless"
"precaution. In a moment, and before I could see how it happened, a"
"wild crow, who had grappled with the shrieking and helpless bird, was"
"entangled in the latterâ s claws, swiftly disengaged by Gunga Dass, and"
"pegged down beside its companion in adversity. Curiosity, it seemed,"
"overpowered the rest of the flock, and almost before Gunga Dass and I"
"had time to withdraw to the tussock, two more captives were struggling"
in the upturned claws of the decoys. So the chase--if I can give it so
dignified a name--continued until Gunga Dass had captured seven crows.
"Five of them he throttled at once, reserving two for further operations"
"another day. I was a good deal impressed by this, to me, novel method of"
"securing food, and complimented Gunga Dass on his skill."

"â It is nothing to do,â  said he. â Tomorrow you must do it for me. You are"
stronger than I am.â 

"This calm assumption of superiority upset me not a little, and I"
"answered peremptorily: â Indeed, you old ruffian! What do you think I"
have given you money for?â 

"â Very well,â  was the unmoved reply. â Perhaps not to-morrow, nor the day"
"after, nor subsequently; but in the end, and for many years, you will"
"catch crows and eat crows, and you will thank your European God that you"
have crows to catch and eat.â 

I could have cheerfully strangled him for this; but judged it best under
the circumstances to smother my resentment. An hour later I was eating
"one of the crows; and, as Gunga Dass had said, thanking my God that I"
had a crow to eat. Never as long as I live shall I forget that evening
meal. The whole population were squatting on the hard sand platform
"opposite their dens, huddled over tiny fires of refuse and dried rushes."
"Death, having once laid his hand upon these men and forborne to strike,"
seemed to stand aloof from them now; for most of our company were
"old men, bent and worn and twisted with years, and women aged to all"
appearance as the Fates themselves. They sat together in knots and
"talked--God only knows what they found to discuss--in low equable tones,"
curiously in contrast to the strident babble with which natives are
accustomed to make day hideous. Now and then an access of that sudden
fury which had possessed me in the morning would lay hold on a man or
woman; and with yells and imprecations the sufferer would attack the
"steep slope until, baffled and bleeding, he fell back on the platform"
incapable of moving a limb. The others would never even raise their
"eyes when this happened, as men too well aware of the futility of their"
fellowsâ  attempts and wearied with their useless repetition. I saw four
such outbursts in the course of the evening.

"Gunga Dass took an eminently business-like view of my situation, and"
"while we were dining--I can afford to laugh at the recollection now,"
but it was painful enough at the time--propounded the terms on which he
"would consent to â doâ  for me. My nine rupees eight annas, he argued, at"
"the rate of three annas a day, would provide me with food for fifty-one"
"days, or about seven weeks; that is to say, he would be willing to cater"
for me for that length of time. At the end of it I was to look after
myself. For a further consideration-- videlicet  my boots--he would be
"willing to allow me to occupy the den next to his own, and would supply"
me with as much dried grass for bedding as he could spare.

"â Very well, Gunga Dass,â  I replied; â to the first terms I cheerfully"
"agree, but, as there is nothing on earth to prevent my killing you as"
you sit here and taking everything that you haveâ  (I thought of the two
"invaluable crows at the time), â I flatly refuse to give you my boots and"
shall take whichever den I please.â 

"The stroke was a bold one, and I was glad when I saw that it had"
"succeeded. Gunga Dass changed his tone immediately, and disavowed all"
intention of asking for my boots. At the time it did not strike me as at
"all strange that I, a Civil Engineer, a man of thirteen yearsâ  standing"
"in the Service, and, I trust, an average Englishman, should thus"
"calmly threaten murder and violence against the man who had, for a"
"consideration it is true, taken me under his wing. I had left the world,"
"it seemed, for centuries. I was as certain then as I am now of my own"
"existence, that in the accursed settlement there was no law save that"
of the strongest; that the living dead men had thrown behind them every
canon of the world which had cast them out; and that I had to depend
for my own life on my strength and vigilance alone. The crew of the
ill-fated  Mignonette  are the only men who would understand my frame of
"mind. â At present,â  I argued to myself, â I am strong and a match for six"
"of these wretches. It is imperatively necessary that I should, for my"
"own sake, keep both health and strength until the hour of my release"
comes--if it ever does.â 

"Fortified with these resolutions, I ate and drank as much as I could,"
"and made Gunga Dass understand that I intended to be his master, and"
that the least sign of insubordination on his part would be visited with
the only punishment I had it in my power to inflict--sudden and violent
"death. Shortly after this I went to bed. That is to say, Gunga Dass gave"
me a double armful of dried bents which I thrust down the mouth of the
"lair to the right of his, and followed myself, feet foremost; the"
hole running about nine feet into the sand with a slight downward
"inclination, and being neatly shored with timbers. From my den, which"
"faced the river-front, I was able to watch the waters of the Sutlej"
flowing past under the light of a young moon and compose myself to sleep
as best I might.

The horrors of that night I shall never forget. My den was nearly as
"narrow as a coffin, and the sides had been worn smooth and greasy by"
"the contact of innumerable naked bodies, added to which it smelled"
abominably. Sleep was altogether out of question to one in my excited
"frame of mind. As the night wore on, it seemed that the entire"
"amphitheatre was filled with legions of unclean devils that, trooping up"
"from the shoals below, mocked the unfortunates in their lairs."

"Personally I am not of an imaginative temperament,--very few Engineers"
"are,--but on that occasion I was as completely prostrated with nervous"
"terror as any woman. After half an hour or so, however, I was able once"
more to calmly review my chances of escape. Any exit by the steep sand
"walls was, of course, impracticable. I had been thoroughly convinced of"
"this some time before. It was possible, just possible, that I might, in"
"the uncertain moonlight, safely run the gauntlet of the rifle shots. The"
place was so full of terror for me that I was prepared to undergo
"any risk in leaving it. Imagine my delight, then, when after creeping"
stealthily to the river-front I found that the infernal boat was not
there. My freedom lay before me in the next few steps!

By walking out to the first shallow pool that lay at the foot of the
"projecting left horn of the horseshoe, I could wade across, turn"
"the flank of the crater, and make my way inland. Without a momentâ s"
hesitation I marched briskly past the tussocks where Gunga Dass had
"snared the crows, and out in the direction of the smooth white sand"
beyond. My first step from the tufts of dried grass showed me how
"utterly futile was any hope of escape; for, as I put my foot down, I"
"felt an indescribable drawing, sucking motion of the sand below. Another"
moment and my leg was swallowed up nearly to the knee. In the moonlight
the whole surface of the sand seemed to be shaken with devilish delight
"at my disappointment. I struggled clear, sweating with terror and"
"exertion, back to the tussocks behind me and fell on my face."

My only means of escape from the semicircle was protected with a
quicksand!

How long I lay I have not the faintest idea; but I was roused at last
"by the malevolent chuckle of Gunga Dass at my ear â I would advise you,"
Protector of the Poorâ  (the ruffian was speaking English) â to return to
"your house. It is unhealthy to lie down here. Moreover, when the boat"
"returns, you will most certainly be rifled at.â  He stood over me in the"
"dim light of the dawn, chuckling and laughing to himself. Suppressing"
my first impulse to catch the man by the neck and throw him on to the
"quicksand, I rose sullenly and followed him to the platform below the"
burrows.

"Suddenly, and futilely as I thought while I spoke, I asked: â Gunga Dass,"
what is the good of the boat if I canâ t get out  anyhow ?â  I recollect
that even in my deepest trouble I had been speculating vaguely on the
waste of ammunition in guarding an already well protected foreshore.

Gunga Dass laughed again and made answer: â They have the boat only in
daytime. It is for the reason that  there is a way . I hope we shall
have the pleasure of your company for much longer time. It is a pleasant
spot when you have been here some years and eaten roast crow long
enough.â 

"I staggered, numbed and helpless, toward the fetid burrow allotted to"
"me, and fell asleep. An hour or so later I was awakened by a piercing"
"scream--the shrill, high-pitched scream of a horse in pain. Those who"
have once heard that will never forget the sound. I found some little
"difficulty in scrambling out of the burrow. When I was in the open, I"
"saw Pornic, my poor old Pornic, lying dead on the sandy soil. How they"
had killed him I cannot guess. Gunga Dass explained that horse was
"better than crow, and â greatest good of greatest number is political"
"maxim. We are now Republic, Mister Jukes, and you are entitled to a fair"
"share of the beast. If you like, we will pass a vote of thanks. Shall I"
propose?â 

"Yes, we were a Republic indeed! A Republic of wild beasts penned at the"
"bottom of a pit, to eat and fight and sleep till we died. I attempted"
"no protest of any kind, but sat down and stared at the hideous sight"
"in front of me. In less time almost than it takes me to write this,"
"Pornicâ s body was divided, in some unclear way or other; the men and"
women had dragged the fragments on to the platform and were preparing
their normal meal. Gunga Dass cooked mine. The almost irresistible
impulse to fly at the sand walls until I was wearied laid hold of me
"afresh, and I had to struggle against it with all my might. Gunga Dass"
was offensively jocular till I told him that if he addressed another
remark of any kind whatever to me I should strangle him where he sat.
"This silenced him till silence became insupportable, and I bade him say"
something.

"â You will live here till you die like the other Feringhi,â  he said,"
"coolly, watching me over the fragment of gristle that he was gnawing."

"â What other Sahib, you swine? Speak at once, and donâ t stop to tell me a"
lie.â 

"â He is over there,â  answered Gunga Dass, pointing to a burrow-mouth"
about four doors to the left of my own. â You can see for yourself. He
"died in the burrow as you will die, and I will die, and as all these men"
and women and the one child will also die.â 

â For pityâ s sake tell me all you know about him. Who was he? When did he
"come, and when did he die?â "

This appeal was a weak step on my part. Gunga Dass only leered and
replied: â I will not--unless you give me something first.â 

"Then I recollected where I was, and struck the man between the eyes,"
"partially stunning him. He stepped down from the platform at once, and,"
"cringing and fawning and weeping and attempting to embrace my feet, led"
me round to the burrow which he had indicated.

â I know nothing whatever about the gentleman. Your God be my witness
"that I do not. He was as anxious to escape as you were, and he was"
"shot from the boat, though we all did all things to prevent him from"
attempting. He was shot here.â  Gunga Dass laid his hand on his lean
stomach and bowed to the earth.

"â Well, and what then? Go on!â "

"â And then--and then, Your Honor, we carried him in to his house and"
"gave him water, and put wet cloths on the wound, and he laid down in his"
house and gave up the ghost.â 

â In how long? In how long?â 

"â About half an hour, after he received his wound. I call Vishnu to"
"witness,â  yelled the wretched man, â that I did everything for him."
"Everything which was possible, that I did!â "

He threw himself down on the ground and clasped my ankles. But I had
"my doubts about Gunga Dassâ s benevolence, and kicked him off as he lay"
protesting.

â I believe you robbed him of everything he had. But I can find out in a
minute or two. How long was the Sahib here?â 

â Nearly a year and a half. I think he must have gone mad. But hear me
swear Protector of the Poor! Wonâ t Your Honor hear me swear that I never
touched an article that belonged to him? What is Your Worship going to
do?â 

I had taken Gunga Dass by the waist and had hauled him on to the
platform opposite the deserted burrow. As I did so I thought of my
wretched fellow-prisonerâ s unspeakable misery among all these horrors
"for eighteen months, and the final agony of dying like a rat in a hole,"
with a bullet-wound in the stomach. Gunga Dass fancied I was going
"to kill him and howled pitifully. The rest of the population, in the"
"plethora that follows a full flesh meal, watched us without stirring."

"â Go inside, Gunga Dass,â  said I, â and fetch it out.â "

I was feeling sick and faint with horror now. Gunga Dass nearly rolled
off the platform and howled aloud.

"â But I am Brahmin, Sahib--a high-caste Brahmin. By your soul, by your"
"fatherâ s soul, do not make me do this thing!â "

"â Brahmin or no Brahmin, by my soul and my fatherâ s soul, in you go!â "
"I said, and, seizing him by the shoulders, I crammed his head into"
"the mouth of the burrow, kicked the rest of him in, and, sitting down,"
covered my face with my hands.

At the end of a few minutes I heard a rustle and a creak; then Gunga
"Dass in a sobbing, choking whisper speaking to himself; then a soft"
thud--and I uncovered my eyes.

The dry sand had turned the corpse entrusted to its keeping into a
yellow-brown mummy. I told Gunga Dass to stand off while I examined it.
"The body--clad in an olive-green hunting-suit much stained and worn,"
with leather pads on the shoulders--was that of a man between thirty and
"forty, above middle height, with light, sandy hair, long mustache, and a"
"rough unkempt beard. The left canine of the upper jaw was missing, and"
a portion of the lobe of the right ear was gone. On the second finger of
"the left hand was a ring--a shield-shaped bloodstone set in gold, with"
a monogram that might have been either â B.K.â  or â B.L.â  On the third
finger of the right hand was a silver ring in the shape of a coiled
"cobra, much worn and tarnished. Gunga Dass deposited a handful of"
"trifles he had picked out of the burrow at my feet, and, covering the"
"face of the body with my handkerchief, I turned to examine these. I give"
the full list in the hope that it may lead to the identification of the
unfortunate man:

"1. Bowl of a briarwood pipe, serrated at the edge; much worn and"
blackened; bound with string at the crew.

2. Two patent-lever keys; wards of both broken.

"3. Tortoise-shell-handled penknife, silver or nickel, name-plate, marked"
with monogram â B.K.â 

"4. Envelope, postmark undecipherable, bearing a Victorian stamp,"
addressed to â Miss Mon--â  (rest illegible)--â hamâ --â nt.â 

5. Imitation crocodile-skin notebook with pencil. First forty-five pages
blank; four and a half illegible; fifteen others filled with private
"memoranda relating chiefly to three persons--a Mrs.L. Singleton,"
"abbreviated several times to â Lot Single,â  â Mrs. S. May,â  and"
"â Garmison,â  referred to in places as â Jerryâ  or â Jack.â "

6. Handle of small-sized hunting-knife. Blade snapped short. Buckâ s
"horn, diamond cut, with swivel and ring on the butt; fragment of cotton"
cord attached.

It must not be supposed that I inventoried all these things on the spot
as fully as I have here written them down. The notebook first attracted
"my attention, and I put it in my pocket with a view of studying it later"
on.

"The rest of the articles I conveyed to my burrow for safetyâ s sake, and"
"there being a methodical man, I inventoried them. I then returned to"
the corpse and ordered Gunga Dass to help me to carry it out to the
"river-front. While we were engaged in this, the exploded shell of an old"
brown cartridge dropped out of one of the pockets and rolled at my feet.
Gunga Dass had not seen it; and I fell to thinking that a man does not
"carry exploded cartridge-cases, especially â browns,â  which will not"
"bear loading twice, about with him when shooting. In other words, that"
cartridge-case had been fired inside the crater. Consequently there must
"be a gun somewhere. I was on the verge of asking Gunga Dass, but checked"
"myself, knowing that he would lie. We laid the body down on the edge of"
the quicksand by the tussocks. It was my intention to push it out and
let it be swallowed up-the only possible mode of burial that I could
think of. I ordered Gunga Dass to go away.

"Then I gingerly put the corpse out on the quicksand. In doing so, it"
"was lying face downward, I tore the frail and rotten khaki shooting-coat"
"open, disclosing a hideous cavity in the back. I have already told you"
"that the dry sand had, as it were, mummified the body. A momentâ s glance"
showed that the gaping hole had been caused by a gun-shot wound; the
gun must have been fired with the muzzle almost touching the back. The
"shooting-coat, being intact, had been drawn over the body after death,"
which must have been instantaneous. The secret of the poor wretchâ s
"death was plain to me in a flash. Some one of the crater, presumably"
"Gunga Dass, must have shot him with his own gun--the gun that fitted the"
brown cartridges. He had never attempted to escape in the face of the
rifle-fire from the boat.

"I pushed the corpse out hastily, and saw it sink from sight literally in"
"a few seconds. I shuddered as I watched. In a dazed, half-conscious way"
I turned to peruse the notebook. A stained and discolored slip of paper
"had been inserted between the binding and the back, and dropped out as I"
opened the pages. This is what it contained: â  Four out from crow-clump:
three left; nine out; two right; three back; two left; fourteen out; two
left; seven out; one left; nine back; two right; six back; four right;
seven back. â  The paper had been burned and charred at the edges. What
it meant I could not understand. I sat down on the dried bents turning
"it over and over between my fingers, until I was aware of Gunga Dass"
standing immediately behind me with glowing eyes and outstretched hands.

â Have you got it?â  he panted. â Will you not let me look at it also? I
swear that I will return it.â 

â Got what? Return what?â  asked.

â That which you have in your hands. It will help us both.â  He stretched
"out his long, bird-like talons, trembling with eagerness."

"â I could never find it,â  he continued. â He had secreted it about his"
"person. Therefore I shot him, but nevertheless I was unable to obtain"
it.â 

Gunga Dass had quite forgotten his little fiction about the
rifle-bullet. I received the information perfectly calmly. Morality is
blunted by consorting with the Dead who are alive.

â What on earth are you raving about? What is it you want me to give
you?â 

"â The piece of paper in the notebook. It will help us both. Oh, you fool!"
You fool! Can you not see what it will do for us? We shall escape!â 

"His voice rose almost to a scream, and he danced with excitement before"
me. I own I was moved at the chance of my getting away.

â Donâ t skip! Explain yourself. Do you mean to say that this slip of
paper will help us? What does it mean?â 

â Read it aloud! Read it aloud! I beg and I pray you to read it aloud.â 

"I did so. Gunga Dass listened delightedly, and drew an irregular line in"
the sand with his fingers.

â See now! It was the length of his gun-barrels without the stock. I have
those barrels. Four gun-barrels out from the place where I caught crows.
Straight out; do you follow me? Then three left. Ah! how well I remember
"when that man worked it out night after night. Then nine out, and so on."
Out is always straight before you across the quicksand. He told me so
before I killed him.â 

â But if you knew all this why didnâ t you get out before?â 

â I did  not  know it. He told me that he was working it out a year and a
"half ago, and how he was working it out night after night when the boat"
"had gone away, and he could get out near the quicksand safely. Then he"
said that we would get away together. But I was afraid that he would
"leave me behind one night when he had worked it all out, and so I shot"
"him. Besides, it is not advisable that the men who once get in here"
"should escape. Only I, and  I  am a Brahmin.â "

The prospect of escape had brought Gunga Dassâ s caste back to him. He
"stood up, walked about and gesticulated violently. Eventually I managed"
"to make him talk soberly, and he told me how this Englishman had spent"
"six months night after night in exploring, inch by inch, the passage"
across the quicksand; how he had declared it to be simplicity itself up
to within about twenty yards of the river bank after turning the flank
of the left horn of the horseshoe. This much he had evidently not
completed when Gunga Dass shot him with his own gun.

In my frenzy of delight at the possibilities of escape I recollect
"shaking hands effusively with Gunga Dass, after we had decided that we"
were to make an attempt to get away that very night. It was weary work
waiting throughout the afternoon.

"About ten oâ clock, as far as I could judge, when the Moon had just risen"
"above the lip of the crater, Gunga Dass made a move for his burrow to"
bring out the gun-barrels whereby to measure our path. All the other
wretched inhabitants had retired to their lairs long ago. The guardian
"boat drifted downstream some hours before, and we were utterly alone by"
"the crow-clump. Gunga Dass, while carrying the gun-barrels, let slip"
the piece of paper which was to be our guide. I stooped down hastily to
"recover it, and, as I did so, I was aware that the diabolical Brahmin"
was aiming a violent blow at the back of my head with the gun-barrels.
It was too late to turn round. I must have received the blow somewhere
on the nape of my neck. A hundred thousand fiery stars danced before my
"eyes, and I fell forwards senseless at the edge of, the quicksand."

"When I recovered consciousness, the Moon was going down, and I was"
sensible of intolerable pain in the back of my head. Gunga Dass had
disappeared and my mouth was full of blood. I lay down again and prayed
that I might die without more ado. Then the unreasoning fury which I had
"before mentioned, laid hold upon me, and I staggered inland toward the"
walls of the crater. It seemed that some one was calling to me in a
whisper--â Sahib! Sahib! Sahib!â  exactly as my bearer used to call me in
the morning I fancied that I was delirious until a handful of sand
fell at my feet. Then I looked up and saw a head peering down into
"the amphitheatre--the head of Dunnoo, my dog-boy, who attended to my"
"collies. As soon as he had attracted my attention, he held up his hand"
"and showed a rope. I motioned, staggering to and fro for the while, that"
he should throw it down. It was a couple of leather punkah-ropes knotted
"together, with a loop at one end. I slipped the loop over my head and"
under my arms; heard Dunnoo urge something forward; was conscious that I
"was being dragged, face downward, up the steep sand slope, and the"
next instant found myself choked and half fainting on the sand
"hills overlooking the crater. Dunnoo, with his face ashy grey in the"
"moonlight, implored me not to stay but to get back to my tent at once."

It seems that he had tracked Pornicâ s footprints fourteen miles across
"the sands to the crater; had returned and told my servants, who flatly"
"refused to meddle with any one, white or black, once fallen into the"
hideous Village of the Dead; whereupon Dunnoo had taken one of my ponies
"and a couple of punkah-ropes, returned to the crater, and hauled me out"
as I have described.

"To cut a long story short, Dunnoo is now my personal servant on a gold"
mohur a month--a sum which I still think far too little for the services
he has rendered. Nothing on earth will induce me to go near that
"devilish spot again, or to reveal its whereabouts more clearly than I"
"have done. Of Gunga Dass I have never found a trace, nor do I wish to"
do. My sole motive in giving this to be published is the hope that some
"one may possibly identify, from the details and the inventory which I"
"have given above, the corpse of the man in the olive-green hunting-suit."




THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING

â Brother to a Prince and fellow to a beggar if he be found worthy.â 

"The Law, as quoted, lays down a fair conduct of life, and one not"
easy to follow. I have been fellow to a beggar again and again under
circumstances which prevented either of us finding out whether the other
"was worthy. I have still to be brother to a Prince, though I once came"
"near to kinship with what might have been a veritable King, and was"
"promised the reversion of a Kingdom--army, law-courts, revenue, and"
"policy all complete. But, to-day, I greatly fear that my King is dead,"
and if I want a crown I must go hunt it for myself.

The beginning of everything was in a railway-train upon the road to Mhow
"from Ajmir. There had been a Deficit in the Budget, which necessitated"
"travelling, not Second-class, which is only half as dear as First-Class,"
"but by Intermediate, which is very awful indeed. There are no cushions"
"in the Intermediate class, and the population are either Intermediate,"
"which is Eurasian, or native, which for a long night journey is nasty,"
"or Loafer, which is amusing though intoxicated. Intermediates do not buy"
"from refreshment-rooms. They carry their food in bundles and pots, and"
"buy sweets from the native sweetmeat-sellers, and drink the roadside"
water. This is why in hot weather Intermediates are taken out of the
"carriages dead, and in all weathers are most properly looked down upon."

My particular Intermediate happened to be empty till I reached
"Nasirabad, when the big black-browed gentleman in shirt-sleeves entered,"
"and, following the custom of Intermediates, passed the time of day. He"
"was a wanderer and a vagabond like myself, but with an educated"
"taste for whisky. He told tales of things he had seen and done, of"
"out-of-the-way corners of the Empire into which he had penetrated, and"
of adventures in which he risked his life for a few daysâ  food.

"â If India was filled with men like you and me, not knowing more than"
"the crows where theyâ d get their next dayâ s rations, it isnâ t seventy"
millions of revenue the land would be paying--itâ s seven hundred
"millions,â  said he; and as I looked at his mouth and chin I was disposed"
to agree with him.

"We talked politics,--the politics of Loaferdom that sees things from"
"the under side where the lath and plaster is not smoothed off,--and we"
talked postal arrangements because my friend wanted to send a telegram
"back from the next station to Ajmir, the turning-off place from the"
Bombay to the Mhow line as you travel westward. My friend had no money
"beyond eight annas which he wanted for dinner, and I had no money at"
"all, owing to the hitch in the Budget before mentioned. Further, I was"
"going into a wilderness where, though I should resume touch with the"
"Treasury, there were no telegraph offices. I was, therefore, unable to"
help him in any way.

"â We might threaten a Station-master, and make him send a wire on tick,â "
"said my friend, â but thatâ d mean inquiries for you and for me, and"
 I â€˜ve got my hands full these days. Did you say you were travelling
back along this line within any days?â 

"â Within ten,â  I said."

â Canâ t you make it eight?â  said he. â Mine is rather urgent business.â 

"â I can send your telegrams within ten days if that will serve you,â  I"
said.

"â I couldnâ t trust the wire to fetch him, now I think of it. Itâ s this"
way. He leaves Delhi on the 23rd for Bombay. That means heâ ll be running
through Ajmir about the night of the 23rd.â 

"â But Iâ m going into the Indian Desert,â  I explained."

"â Well  and  good,â  said he. â Youâ ll be changing at Marwar Junction to"
"get into Jodhpore territory,--you must do that,--and heâ ll be coming"
through Marwar Junction in the early morning of the 24th by the
Bombay Mail. Can you be at Marwar Junction on that time? â€˜T wonâ t be
"inconveniencing you, because I know that thereâ s precious few pickings"
to be got out of these Central India States--even though you pretend to
be correspondent of the â€˜Backwoodsman.â â 

â Have you ever tried that trick?â  I asked.

"â Again and again, but the Residents find you out, and then you get"
escorted to the Border before youâ ve time to get your knife into them.
But about my friend here. I  must  give him a word oâ  mouth to tell him
"whatâ s come to me, or else he wonâ t know where to go. I would take it"
more than kind of you if you was to come out of Central India in time to
"catch him at Marwar Junction, and say to him, â€˜He has gone South for the"
"week.â  Heâ ll know what that means. Heâ s a big man with a red beard, and"
a great swell he is. Youâ ll find him sleeping like a gentleman with
all his luggage round him in a Second-class apartment. But donâ t you be
"afraid. Slip down the window and say, â€˜He has gone South for the week,â "
and heâ ll tumble. Itâ s only cutting your time of stay in those parts
"by two days. I ask you as a stranger--going to the West,â  he said, with"
emphasis.

â Where have  you  come from?â  said I.

"â From the East,â  said he, â and I am hoping that you will give him the"
message on the Square--for the sake of my Mother as well as your own.â 

Englishmen are not usually softened by appeals to the memory of their
"mothers; but for certain reasons, which will be fully apparent, I saw"
fit to agree.

"â Itâ s more than a little matter,â  said he, â and thatâ s why I asked"
you to do it--and now I know that I can depend on you doing it. A
"Second-class carriage at Marwar Junction, and a red-haired man asleep"
"in it. Youâ ll be sure to remember. I get out at the next station, and I"
must hold on there till he comes or sends me what I want.â 

"â Iâ ll give the message if I catch him,â  I said, â and for the sake of"
your Mother as well as mine Iâ ll give you a word of advice. Donâ t try
to run the Central India States just now as the correspondent of the
"â€˜Backwoodsman.â  Thereâ s a real one knocking about here, and it might"
lead to trouble.â 

"â Thank you,â  said he, simply; â and when will the swine be gone? I"
canâ t starve because heâ s ruining my work. I wanted to get hold of the
"Degumber Rajah down here about his fatherâ s widow, and give him a jump.â "

"â What did he do to his fatherâ s widow, then?â "

â Filled her up with red pepper and slippered her to death as she hung
"from a beam. I found that out myself, and Iâ m the only man that would"
dare going into the State to get hush-money for it. Theyâ ll try to
"poison me, same as they did in Chortumna when I went on the loot there."
But youâ ll give the man at Marwar Junction my message?â 

"He got out at a little roadside station, and I reflected. I had heard,"
"more than once, of men personating correspondents of newspapers and"
"bleeding small Native States with threats of exposure, but I had never"
"met any of the caste before. They lead a hard life, and generally die"
with great suddenness. The Native States have a wholesome horror of
"English newspapers, which may throw light on their peculiar methods of"
"government, and do their best to choke correspondents with champagne,"
or drive them out of their mind with four-in-hand barouches. They do not
understand that nobody cares a straw for the internal administration
of Native States so long as oppression and crime are kept within decent
"limits, and the ruler is not drugged, drunk, or diseased from one end"
"of the year to the other. They are the dark places of the earth, full"
"of unimaginable cruelty, touching the Railway and the Telegraph on one"
"side, and, on the other, the days of Harun-al-Raschid. When I left the"
"train I did business with divers Kings, and in eight days passed through"
many changes of life. Sometimes I wore dress-clothes and consorted with
"Princes and Politicals, drinking from crystal and eating from silver."
"Sometimes I lay out upon the ground and devoured what I could get, from"
"a plate made of leaves, and drank the running water, and slept under the"
same rug as my servant. It was all in the dayâ s work.

"Then I headed for the Great Indian Desert upon the proper date, as I"
"had promised, and the night Mail set me down at Marwar Junction, where"
"a funny little, happy-go-lucky, native-managed railway runs to Jodhpore."
The Bombay Mail from Delhi makes a short halt at Marwar. She arrived
"just as I got in, and I had just time to hurry to her platform and go"
down the carriages. There was only one Second-class on the train.
"I slipped the window and looked down upon a flaming-red beard, half"
"covered by a railway-rug. That was my man, fast asleep, and I dug him"
"gently in the ribs. He woke with a grunt, and I saw his face in the"
light of the lamps. It was a great and shining face.

â Tickets again?â  said he.

"â No,â  said I. â I am to tell you that he is gone South for the week. He"
has gone South for the week!â 

The train had begun to move out. The red man rubbed his eyes. â He
"has gone South for the week,â  he repeated. â Now thatâ s just like his"
impidence. Did he say that I was to give you anything? â€˜Cause I wonâ t.â 

"â He didnâ t,â  I said, and dropped away, and watched the red lights die"
out in the dark. It was horribly cold because the wind was blowing off
the sands. I climbed into my own train--not an Intermediate carriage
this time--and went to sleep.

If the man with the beard had given me a rupee I should have kept it as
a memento of a rather curious affair. But the consciousness of having
done my duty was my only reward.

Later on I reflected that two gentlemen like my friends could not do any
"good if they foregathered and personated correspondents of newspapers,"
"and might, if they blackmailed one of the little rat-trap States"
"of Central India or Southern Rajputana, get themselves into serious"
difficulties. I therefore took some trouble to describe them as
accurately as I could remember to people who would be interested in
"deporting them; and succeeded, so I was later informed, in having them"
headed back from the Degumber borders.

"Then I became respectable, and returned to an office where there were no"
Kings and no incidents outside the daily manufacture of a newspaper. A
"newspaper office seems to attract every conceivable sort of person, to"
"the prejudice of discipline. Zenana-mission ladies arrive, and beg that"
the Editor will instantly abandon all his duties to describe a Christian
prize-giving in a back slum of a perfectly inaccessible village;
Colonels who have been overpassed for command sit down and sketch the
"outline of a series of ten, twelve, or twenty-four leading articles on"
Seniority  versus  Selection; missionaries wish to know why they have
"not been permitted to escape from their regular vehicles of abuse, and"
swear at a brother missionary under special patronage of the editorial
We; stranded theatrical companies troop up to explain that they cannot
"pay for their advertisements, but on their return from New Zealand"
or Tahiti will do so with interest; inventors of patent punka-pulling
"machines, carriage couplings, and unbreakable swords and axletrees call"
with specifications in their pockets and hours at their disposal; tea
companies enter and elaborate their prospectuses with the office pens;
secretaries of ball committees clamour to have the glories of their last
"dance more fully described; strange ladies rustle in and say, â I want"
"a hundred ladyâ s cards printed  at once , please,â  which is manifestly"
part of an Editorâ s duty; and every dissolute ruffian that ever tramped
the Grand Trunk Road makes it his business to ask for employment as a
"proof-reader. And, all the time, the telephone-bell is ringing madly,"
"and Kings are being killed on the Continent, and Empires are saying,"
"â Youâ re another,â  and Mister Gladstone is calling down brimstone upon"
"the British Dominions, and the little black copyboys are whining,"
"â  kaa-pi chay-ha-yeh â  (â Copy wantedâ ), like tired bees, and most of the"
paper is as blank as Modredâ s shield.

But that is the amusing part of the year. There are six other months
"when none ever come to call, and the thermometer walks inch by inch"
"up to the top of the glass, and the office is darkened to just above"
"reading-light, and the press-machines are red-hot to touch, and nobody"
writes anything but accounts of amusements in the Hill-stations or
"obituary notices. Then the telephone becomes a tinkling terror, because"
it tells you of the sudden deaths of men and women that you knew
"intimately, and the prickly heat covers you with a garment, and you"
sit down and write: â A slight increase of sickness is reported from
the Khuda Janta Khan District. The outbreak is purely sporadic in
"its nature, and, thanks to the energetic efforts of the District"
"authorities, is now almost at an end. It is, however, with deep regret"
"we record the death,â  etc."

"Then the sickness really breaks out, and the less recording and"
reporting the better for the peace of the subscribers. But the Empires
"and the Kings continue to divert themselves as selfishly as before, and"
the Foreman thinks that a daily paper really ought to come out once in
"twenty-four hours, and all the people at the Hill-stations in the"
"middle of their amusements say, â Good gracious! why canâ t the paper be"
sparkling? Iâ m sure thereâ s plenty going on up here.â 

"That is the dark half of the moon, and, as the advertisements say, â must"
be experienced to be appreciated.â 

"It was in that season, and a remarkably evil season, that the paper"
"began running the last issue of the week on Saturday night, which is to"
"say Sunday morning, after the custom of a London paper. This was a great"
"convenience, for immediately after the paper was put to bed the dawn"
would lower the thermometer from 96 degrees to almost 84 degrees for
"half an hour, and in that chill--you have no idea how cold is 84 degrees"
on the grass until you begin to pray for it--a very tired man could get
off to sleep ere the heat roused him.

One Saturday night it was my pleasant duty to put the paper to bed
alone. A King or courtier or a courtesan or a Community was going to
"die or get a new Constitution, or do something that was important on"
"the other side of the world, and the paper was to be held open till the"
latest possible minute in order to catch the telegram.

"It was a pitchy-black night, as stifling as a June night can be, and"
"the  loo , the red-hot wind from the westward, was booming among the"
tinder-dry trees and pretending that the rain was on its heels. Now and
again a spot of almost boiling water would fall on the dust with the
"flop of a frog, but all our weary world knew that was only pretence. It"
"was a shade cooler in the press-room than the office, so I sat there,"
"while the type ticked and clicked, and the night-jars hooted at the"
"windows, and the all but naked compositors wiped the sweat from their"
"foreheads and called for water. The thing that was keeping us back,"
"whatever it was, would not come off, though the  loo  dropped and the"
"last type was set, and the whole round earth stood still in the choking"
"heat, with its finger on its lip, to wait the event. I drowsed, and"
"wondered whether the telegraph was a blessing, and whether this dying"
"man, or struggling people, might be aware of the inconvenience the delay"
was causing. There was no special reason beyond the heat and worry to
"make tension, but, as the clock-hands crept up to three o-clock and the"
machines spun their fly-wheels two and three times to see that all was
"in order, before I said the word that would set them off, I could have"
shrieked aloud.

Then the roar and rattle of the wheels shivered the quiet into little
"bits. I rose to go away, but two men in white clothes stood in front"
"of me. The first one said, â Itâ s him!â  The second said, â So it is!â  And"
"they both laughed almost as loudly as the machinery roared, and mopped"
"their foreheads. â We seed there was a light burning across the road,"
"and we were sleeping in that ditch there for coolness, and I said to my"
"friend here, â€˜The office is open. Letâ s come along and speak to him as"
"turned us back from Degumber State,â â  said the smaller of the two."
"He was the man I had met in the Mhow train, and his fellow was the"
red-bearded man of Marwar Junction. There was no mistaking the eyebrows
of the one or the beard of the other.

"I was not pleased, because I wished to go to sleep, not to squabble with"
loafers. â What do you want?â  I asked.

"â Half an hourâ s talk with you, cool and comfortable, in the office,â "
"said the red-bearded man. â Weâ d  like  some drink,--the Contrack doesnâ t"
"begin yet, Peachey, so you neednâ t look,--but what we really want is"
"advice. We donâ t want money. We ask you as a favour, because we found"
out you did us a bad turn about Degumber State.â 

I led from the press-room to the stifling office with the maps on the
"walls, and the red-haired man rubbed his hands. â Thatâ s something"
"like,â  said he. â This was the proper shop to come to. Now, Sir, let"
"me introduce you to Brother Peachey Carnehan, thatâ s him, and Brother"
"Daniel Dravot, that is me, and the less said about our professions"
"the better, for we have been most things in our time--soldier,"
"sailor, compositor, photographer, proof-reader, street-preacher, and"
correspondents of the â€˜Backwoodsmanâ  when we thought the paper wanted
"one. Carnehan is sober, and so am I. Look at us first, and see thatâ s"
sure. It will save you cutting into my talk. Weâ ll take one of your
"cigars apiece, and you shall see us light up.â "

"I watched the test. The men were absolutely sober, so I gave them each a"
tepid whisky-and-soda.

"â Well  and  good,â  said Carnehan of the eyebrows, wiping the froth"
"from his moustache. â Let me talk now, Dan. We have been all over India,"
"mostly on foot. We have been boiler-fitters, engine-drivers, petty"
"contractors, and all that, and we have decided that India isnâ t big"
enough for such as us.â 

They certainly were too big for the office. Dravotâ s beard seemed to
"fill half the room and Carnehanâ s shoulders the other half, as they sat"
on the big table. Carnehan continued: â The country isnâ t half worked
out because they that governs it wonâ t let you touch it. They spend all
"their blessed time in governing it, and you canâ t lift a spade, nor"
"chip a rock, nor look for oil, nor anything like that, without all the"
"Government saying, â€˜Leave it alone, and let us govern.â  Therefore, such"
" as  it is, we will let it alone, and go away to some other place where"
"a man isnâ t crowded and can come to his own. We are not little men, and"
"there is nothing that we are afraid of except Drink, and we have signed"
a Contrack on that.  Therefore  we are going away to be Kings.â 

"â Kings in our own right,â  muttered Dravot."

"â Yes, of course,â  I said. â Youâ ve been tramping in the sun, and itâ s"
"a very warm night, and hadnâ t you better sleep over the notion? Come"
to-morrow.â 

"â Neither drunk nor sunstruck,â  said Dravot. â We have slept over the"
"notion half a year, and require to see Books and Atlases, and we have"
decided that there is only one place now in the world that two strong
men can Sar-a- whack . They call it Kafiristan. By my reckoning itâ s the
"top right-hand corner of Afghanistan, not more than three hundred miles"
"from Peshawar. They have two and thirty heathen idols there, and weâ ll"
"be the thirty-third and fourth. Itâ s a mountaineous country, the women"
of those parts are very beautiful.â 

"â But that is provided against in the Contrack,â  said Carnehan. â Neither"
"Women nor Liqu-or, Daniel.â "

"â And thatâ s all we know, except that no one has gone there, and they"
"fight, and in any place where they fight a man who knows how to drill"
men can always be a King. We shall go to those parts and say to any King
"we find, â€˜Dâ  you want to vanquish your foes?â  and we will show him how"
to drill men; for that we know better than anything else. Then we will
subvert that King and seize his Throne and establish a Dy-nasty.â 

"â Youâ ll be cut to pieces before youâ re fifty miles across the Border,â "
I said. â You have to travel through Afghanistan to get to that country.
"Itâ s one mass of mountains and peaks and glaciers, and no Englishman has"
"been through it. The people are utter brutes, and even if you reached"
them you couldnâ t do anything.â 

"â Thatâ s more like,â  said Carnehan. â If you could think us a little more"
mad we would be more pleased. We have come to you to know about this
"country, to read a book about it, and to be shown maps. We want you to"
tell us that we are fools and to show us your books.â  He turned to the
bookcases.

â Are you at all in earnest?â  I said.

"â A little,â  said Dravot, sweetly. â As big a map as you have got, even"
"if itâ s all blank where Kafiristan is, and any books youâ ve got. We can"
"read, though we arenâ t very educated.â "

I uncased the big thirty-two-miles-to-the-inch map of India and two
"smaller Frontier maps, hauled down volume INF-KAN of the â Encyclopaedia"
"Britannica,â  and the men consulted them."

"â See here!â  said Dravot, his thumb on the map. â Up to Jagdallak, Peachey"
and me know the road. We was there with Robertâ s Army. Weâ ll have to
turn off to the right at Jagdallak through Laghmann territory. Then we
get among the hills--fourteen thousand feet--fifteen thousand--it will
"be cold work there, but it donâ t look very far on the map.â "

I handed him Wood on the â Sources of the Oxus.â  Carnehan was deep in the
â Encyclopaedia.â 

"â Theyâ re a mixed lot,â  said Dravot, reflectively; â and it wonâ t help"
us to know the names of their tribes. The more tribes the more theyâ ll
"fight, and the better for us. From Jagdallak to Ashang. Hâ mm!â "

â But all the information about the country is as sketchy and inaccurate
"as can be,â  I protested. â No one knows anything about it really. Hereâ s"
the file of the â€˜United Servicesâ  Institute.â  Read what Bellew says.â 

"â Blow Bellew!â  said Carnehan. â Dan, theyâ re a stinkinâ  lot of heathens,"
but this book here says they think theyâ re related to us English.â 

"I smoked while the men poured over Raverty, Wood, the maps, and the"
â Encyclopaedia.â 

"â There is no use your waiting,â  said Dravot, politely. â Itâ s about four"
"oâ clock now. Weâ ll go before six oâ clock if you want to sleep, and we"
wonâ t steal any of the papers. Donâ t you sit up. Weâ re two harmless
"lunatics, and if you come to-morrow evening down to the Serai weâ ll say"
good-bye to you.â 

"â You  are  two fools,â  I answered. â Youâ ll be turned back at the"
Frontier or cut up the minute you set foot in Afghanistan. Do you want
any money or a recommendation down-country? I can help you to the chance
of work next week.â 

"â Next week we shall be hard at work ourselves, thank you,â  said Dravot."
â It isnâ t so easy being a King as it looks. When weâ ve got our Kingdom
"in going order weâ ll let you know, and you can come up and help us"
govern it.â 

"â Would two lunatics make a Contrack like that?â  said Carnehan, with"
"subdued pride, showing me a greasy half-sheet of notepaper on which was"
"written the following. I copied it, then and there, as a curiosity."

This Contract between me and you persuing witnesseth in
the name of God--Amen and so forth.

(One)     That me and you will settle this matter
"together; i.e., to be Kings of Kafiristan."

"(Two)     That you and me will not, while this"
"matter is being settled, look at any"
"Liquor, nor any Woman, black, white,"
"or brown, so as to get mixed up with"
one or the other harmful.

(Three)   That we conduct ourselves with Dignity
"and Discretion, and if one of us gets"
into trouble the other will stay by him.

Signed by you and me this day.
Peachey Taliaferro Carnehan.
Daniel Dravot.
Both Gentlemen at Large.

"â There was no need for the last article,â  said Carnehan, blushing"
modestly; â but it looks regular. Now you know the sort of men that
"loafers are,--we  are  loafers, Dan, until we get out of India,--and"
 do  you think that we would sign a Contrack like that unless we was
in earnest? We have kept away from the two things that make life worth
having.â 

â You wonâ t enjoy your lives much longer if you are going to try this
"idiotic adventure. Donâ t set the office on fire,â  I said, â and go away"
before nine oâ clock.â 

I left them still poring over the maps and making notes on the back
"of the â Contrack.â  â Be sure to come down to the Serai to-morrow,â  were"
their parting words.

The Kumharsen Serai is the great foursquare sink of humanity where the
strings of camels and horses from the North load and unload. All the
"nationalities of Central Asia may be found there, and most of the folk"
"of India proper. Balkh and Bokhara there meet Bengal and Bombay, and try"
"to draw eye-teeth. You can buy ponies, turquoises, Persian pussy-cats,"
"saddle-bags, fat-tailed sheep, and musk in the Kumharsen Serai, and get"
many strange things for nothing. In the afternoon I went down to see
whether my friends intended to keep their word or were lying there
drunk.

"A priest attired in fragments of ribbons and rags stalked up to me,"
gravely twisting a childâ s paper whirligig. Behind him was his servant
bending under the load of a crate of mud toys. The two were loading up
"two camels, and the inhabitants of the Serai watched them with shrieks"
of laughter.

"â The priest is mad,â  said a horse-dealer to me. â He is going up to Kabul"
to sell toys to the Amir. He will either be raised to honour or have his
head cut off. He came in here this morning and has been behaving madly
ever since.â 

"â The witless are under the protection of God,â  stammered a flat-cheeked"
Usbeg in broken Hindi. â They foretell future events.â 

â Would they could have foretold that my caravan would have been cut up
by the Shinwaris almost within shadow of the Pass!â  grunted the Eusufzai
agent of a Rajputana trading-house whose goods had been diverted into
"the hands of other robbers just across the Border, and whose misfortunes"
"were the laughing-stock of the bazaar. â OhÃ©, priest, whence come you and"
whither do you go?â 

"â From Roum have I come,â  shouted the priest, waving his whirligig; â from"
"Roum, blown by the breath of a hundred devils across the sea! O thieves,"
"robbers, liars, the blessing of Pir Khan on pigs, dogs, and perjurers!"
Who will take the Protected of God to the North to sell charms that are
"never still to the Amir? The camels shall not gall, the sons shall not"
"fall sick, and the wives shall remain faithful while they are away,"
of the men who give me place in their caravan. Who will assist me to
slipper the King of the Roos with a golden slipper with a silver heel?
The protection of Pir Khan be upon his labours!â  He spread out the
skirts of his gabardine and pirouetted between the lines of tethered
horses.

"â There starts a caravan from Peshawar to Kabul in twenty days,"
" Huzrut ,â  said the Eusufzai trader. â My camels go therewith. Do thou"
also go and bring us good luck.â 

â I will go even now!â  shouted the priest. â I will depart upon my winged
"camels, and be at Peshawar in a day! Ho! Hazar Mir Khan,â  he yelled to"
"his servant, â drive out the camels, but let me first mount my own.â "

"He leaped on the back of his beast as it knelt, and, turning round to"
"me, cried, â Come thou also, Sahib, a little along the road, and I will"
sell thee a charm--an amulet that shall make thee King of Kafiristan.â 

"Then the light broke upon me, and I followed the two camels out of the"
Serai till we reached open road and the priest halted.

â What dâ  you think oâ  that?â  said he in English. â Carnehan canâ t talk
"their patter, so Iâ ve made him my servant. He makes a handsome servant."
â€˜T isnâ t for nothing that Iâ ve been knocking about the country for
fourteen years. Didnâ t I do that talk neat? Weâ ll hitch on to a caravan
"at Peshawar till we get to Jagdallak, and then weâ ll see if we can get"
"donkeys for our camels, and strike into Kafiristan. Whirligigs for the"
"Amir, O Lorâ ! Put your hand under the camelbags and tell me what you"
feel.â 

"I felt the butt of a Martini, and another and another."

"â Twenty of â€˜em,â  said Dravot, placidly. â Twenty of â€˜em and ammunition to"
"correspond, under the whirligigs and the mud dolls.â "

â Heaven help you if you are caught with those things!â  I said. â A
Martini is worth her weight in silver among the Pathans.â 

"â Fifteen hundred rupees of capital--every rupee we could beg, borrow,"
"or steal--are invested on these two camels,â  said Dravot. â We wonâ t get"
caught. Weâ re going through the Khaiber with a regular caravan. Whoâ d
touch a poor mad priest?â 

"â Have you got everything you want?â  I asked, overcome with astonishment."

"â Not yet, but we shall soon. Give us a memento of your kindness,"
" Brother . You did me a service yesterday, and that time in Marwar. Half"
"my Kingdom shall you have, as the saying is.â  I slipped a small charm"
compass from my watch-chain and handed it up to the priest.

"â Good-bye,â  said Dravot, giving me hand cautiously. â Itâ s the last time"
weâ ll shake hands with an Englishman these many days. Shake hands with
"him, Carnehan,â  he cried, as the second camel passed me."

Carnehan leaned down and shook hands. Then the camels passed away along
"the dusty road, and I was left alone to wonder. My eye could detect no"
failure in the disguises. The scene in the Serai proved that they were
"complete to the native mind. There was just the chance, therefore, that"
Carnehan and Dravot would be able to wander through Afghanistan without
"detection. But, beyond, they would find death--certain and awful death."

"Ten days later a native correspondent, giving me the news of the day"
"from Peshawar, wound up his letter with: â There has been much laughter"
here on account of a certain mad priest who is going in his estimation
to sell petty gauds and insignificant trinkets which he ascribes as
great charms to H. H. the Amir of Bokhara. He passed through Peshawar
and associated himself to the Second Summer caravan that goes to Kabul.
The merchants are pleased because through superstition they imagine that
such mad fellows bring good fortune.â 

"The two, then, were beyond the Border. I would have prayed for them, but"
"that night a real King died in Europe, and demanded an obituary notice."

The wheel of the world swings through the same phases again and again.
"Summer passed and winter thereafter, and came and passed again. The"
"daily paper continued and I with it, and upon the third summer there"
"fell a hot night, a night issue, and a strained waiting for something to"
"be telegraphed from the other side of the world, exactly as had happened"
"before. A few great men had died in the past two years, the machines"
"worked with more clatter, and some of the trees in the office garden"
were a few feet taller. But that was all the difference.

"I passed over to the press-room, and went through just such a scene as"
I have already described. The nervous tension was stronger than it
"had been two years before, and I felt the heat more acutely. At three"
"oâ clock I cried, â Print off,â  and turned to go, when there crept to my"
"chair what was left of a man. He was bent into a circle, his head was"
"sunk between his shoulders, and he moved his feet one over the other"
like a bear. I could hardly see whether he walked or crawled--this
"rag-wrapped, whining cripple who addressed me by name, crying that he"
was come back. â Can you give me a drink?â  he whimpered. â For the Lordâ s
"sake, give me a drink!â "

"I went back to the office, the man following with groans of pain, and I"
turned up the lamp.

"â Donâ t you know me?â  he gasped, dropping into a chair, and he turned his"
"drawn face, surmounted by a shock of gray hair, to the light."

I looked at him intently. Once before had I seen eyebrows that met over
"the nose in an inch-broad black band, but for the life of me I could not"
tell where.

"â I donâ t know you,â  I said, handing him the whisky. â What can I do for"
you?â 

"He took a gulp of the spirit raw, and shivered in spite of the"
suffocating heat.

"â Iâ ve come back,â  he repeated; â and I was the King of Kafiristan--me and"
Dravot--crowned Kings we was! In this office we settled it--you setting
"there and giving us the books. I am Peachey,--Peachey Taliaferro"
"Carnehan,--and youâ ve been setting here ever since--O Lord!â "

"I was more than a little astonished, and expressed my feelings"
accordingly.

"â Itâ s true,â  said Carnehan, with a dry cackle, nursing his feet, which"
"were wrapped in rags--â true as gospel. Kings we were, with crowns upon"
"our heads--me and Dravot--poor Dan--oh, poor, poor Dan, that would never"
"take advice, not though I begged of him!â "

"â Take the whisky,â  I said, â and take your own time. Tell me all you can"
recollect of everything from beginning to end. You got across the Border
"on your camels, Dravot dressed as a mad priest and you his servant. Do"
you remember that?â 

"â I ainâ t mad--yet, but I shall be that way soon. Of course I remember."
"Keep looking at me, or maybe my words will go all to pieces. Keep"
looking at me in my eyes and donâ t say anything.â 

I leaned forward and looked into his face as steadily as I could. He
dropped one hand upon the table and I grasped it by the wrist. It
"was twisted like a birdâ s claw, and upon the back was a ragged, red,"
diamond-shaped scar.

"â No, donâ t look there. Look at  me ,â  said Carnehan. â That comes"
"afterward, but for the Lordâ s sake donâ t distrack me. We left with that"
"caravan, me and Dravot playing all sorts of antics to amuse the people"
we were with. Dravot used to make us laugh in the evenings when all the
"people was cooking their dinners--cooking their dinners, and... what did"
they do then? They lit little fires with sparks that went into Dravotâ s
"beard, and we all laughed--fit to die. Little red fires they was, going"
into Dravotâ s big red beard--so funny.â  His eyes left mine and he smiled
foolishly.

"â You went as far as Jagdallak with that caravan,â  I said, at a venture,"
"â after you had lit those fires. To Jagdallak, where you turned off to"
try to get into Kafiristan.â 

"â No, we didnâ t, neither. What are you talking about? We turned off"
"before Jagdallak, because we heard the roads was good. But they wasnâ t"
good enough for our two camels--mine and Dravotâ s. When we left the
"caravan, Dravot took off all his clothes and mine too, and said we would"
"be heathen, because the Kafirs didnâ t allow Mohammedans to talk to them."
"So we dressed betwixt and between, and such a sight as Daniel Dravot"
"I never saw yet nor expect to see again. He burned half his beard, and"
"slung a sheepskin over his shoulder, and shaved his head into patterns."
"He shaved mine too, and made me wear outrageous things to look like"
"a heathen. That was in a most mountaineous country, and our camels"
couldnâ t go along any more because of the mountains. They were tall and
"black, and coming home I saw them fight like wild goats--there are lots"
"of goats in Kafiristan. And these mountains, they never keep still, no"
"more than the goats. Always fighting they are, and donâ t let you sleep"
at night.â 

"â Take some more whisky,â  I said, very slowly. â What did you and Daniel"
Dravot do when the camels could go no farther because of the rough roads
that led into Kafiristan?â 

â What did which do? There was a party called Peachey Taliaferro Carnehan
that was with Dravot. Shall I tell you about him? He died out there in
"the cold. Slap from the bridge fell old Peachey, turning and twisting in"
the air like a penny whirligig that you can sell to the Amir. No; they
"was two for three haâ pence, those whirligigs, or I am much mistaken and"
"woeful sore.... And then these camels were no use, and Peachey said to"
"Dravot, â€˜For the Lordâ s sake letâ s get out of this before our heads"
"are chopped off,â  and with that they killed the camels all among the"
"mountains, not having anything in particular to eat, but first they took"
"off the boxes with the guns and the ammunition, till two men came along"
"driving four mules. Dravot up and dances in front of them, singing,"
"â€˜Sell me four mules.â  Says the first man, â€˜If you are rich enough to"
"buy, you are rich enough to rob;â  but before ever he could put his hand"
"to his knife, Dravot breaks his neck over his knee, and the other party"
runs away. So Carnehan loaded the mules with the rifles that was taken
"off the camels, and together we starts forward into those bitter-cold"
"mountaineous parts, and never a road broader than the back of your"
hand.â 

"He paused for a moment, while I asked him if he could remember the"
nature of the country through which he had journeyed.

"â I am telling you as straight as I can, but my head isnâ t as good as it"
might be. They drove nails through it to make me hear better how Dravot
"died. The country was mountaineous and the mules were most contrary,"
"and the inhabitants was dispersed and solitary. They went up and up, and"
"down and down, and that other party, Carnehan, was imploring of Dravot"
"not to sing and whistle so loud, for fear of bringing down the tremenjus"
avalanches. But Dravot says that if a King couldnâ t sing it wasnâ t worth
"being King, and whacked the mules over the rump, and never took no"
heed for ten cold days. We came to a big level valley all among the
"mountains, and the mules were near dead, so we killed them, not having"
"anything in special for them or us to eat. We sat upon the boxes, and"
played odd and even with the cartridges that was jolted out.

"â Then ten men with bows and arrows ran down that valley, chasing twenty"
"men with bows and arrows, and the row was tremenjus. They was fair"
men--fairer than you or me--with yellow hair and remarkable well built.
"Says Dravot, unpacking the guns, â€˜This is the beginning of the business."
"Weâ ll fight for the ten men,â  and with that he fires two rifles at the"
"twenty men, and drops one of them at two hundred yards from the rock"
"where he was sitting. The other men began to run, but Carnehan and"
"Dravot sits on the boxes picking them off at all ranges, up and down the"
"valley. Then we goes up to the ten men that had run across the snow too,"
and they fires a footy little arrow at us. Dravot he shoots above their
"heads, and they all falls down flat. Then he walks over them and kicks"
"them, and then he lifts them up and shakes hands all round to make them"
"friendly like. He calls them and gives them the boxes to carry, and"
waves his hand for all the world as though he was King already. They
takes the boxes and him across the valley and up the hill into a pine
"wood on the top, where there was half a dozen big stone idols. Dravot"
he goes to the biggest--a fellow they call Imbra--and lays a rifle and a
"cartridge at his feet, rubbing his nose respectfully with his own nose,"
"patting him on the head, and nods his head, and says, â€˜Thatâ s all right."
"Iâ m in the know too, and these old jimjams are my friends.â  Then he"
"opens his mouth and points down it, and when the first man brings him"
"food, he says, â€˜No;â  and when the second man brings him food, he says"
â€˜no;â  but when one of the old priests and the boss of the village brings
"him food, he says, â€˜Yes;â  very haughty, and eats it slow. That was how"
"we came to our first village without any trouble, just as though we"
had tumbled from the skies. But we tumbled from one of those damned
"rope-bridges, you see, and--you couldnâ t expect a man to laugh much"
after that?â 

"â Take some more whisky and go on,â  I said. â That was the first village"
you came into. How did you get to be King?â 

"â I wasnâ t King,â  said Carnehan. â Dravot he was the King, and a handsome"
man he looked with the gold crown on his head and all. Him and the other
"party stayed in that village, and every morning Dravot sat by the side"
"of old Imbra, and the people came and worshipped. That was Dravotâ s"
"order. Then a lot of men came into the valley, and Carnehan Dravot picks"
"them off with the rifles before they knew where they was, and runs down"
"into the valley and up again the other side, and finds another village,"
"same as the first one, and the people all falls down flat on their"
"faces, and Dravot says, â€˜Now what is the trouble between you two"
"villages?â  and the people points to a woman, as fair as you or me, that"
"was carried off, and Dravot takes her back to the first village and"
counts up the dead--eight there was. For each dead man Dravot pours
"a little milk on the ground and waves his arms like a whirligig, and"
"â€˜Thatâ s all right,â  says he. Then he and Carnehan takes the big boss of"
"each village by the arm, and walks them down the valley, and shows them"
"how to scratch a line with a spear right down the valley, and gives each"
a sod of turf from both sides of the line. Then all the people comes
"down and shouts like the devil and all, and Dravot says, â€˜Go and dig the"
"land, and be fruitful and multiply,â  which they did, though they didnâ t"
understand. Then we asks the names of things in their lingo--bread and
water and fire and idols and such; and Dravot leads the priest of each
"village up to the idol, and says he must sit there and judge the people,"
and if anything goes wrong he is to be shot.

â Next week they was all turning up the land in the valley as quiet as
"bees and much prettier, and the priests heard all the complaints and"
"told Dravot in dumb-show what it was about. â€˜Thatâ s just the beginning,â "
says Dravot. â€˜They think weâ re Gods.â  He and Carnehan picks out twenty
good men and shows them how to click off a rifle and form fours and
"advance in line; and they was very pleased to do so, and clever to see"
"the hang of it. Then he takes out his pipe and his baccy-pouch, and"
"leaves one at one village and one at the other, and off we two goes to"
"see what was to be done in the next valley. That was all rock, and there"
"was a little village there, and Carnehan says, â€˜Send â€˜em to the old"
"valley to plant,â  and takes â€˜em there and gives â€˜em some land that"
"wasnâ t took before. They were a poor lot, and we blooded â€˜em with a kid"
"before letting â€˜em into the new Kingdom. That was to impress the people,"
"and then they settled down quiet, and Carnehan went back to Dravot, who"
"had got into another valley, all snow and ice and most mountaineous."
"There was no people there, and the Army got afraid; so Dravot shoots"
"one of them, and goes on till he finds some people in a village, and the"
Army explains that unless the people wants to be killed they had better
"not shoot their little matchlocks, for they had matchlocks. We makes"
"friends with the priest, and I stays there alone with two of the Army,"
teaching the men how to drill; and a thundering big Chief comes across
"the snow with kettledrums and horns twanging, because he heard there was"
a new God kicking about. Carnehan sights for the brown of the men half
a mile across the snow and wings one of them. Then he sends a message
"to the Chief that, unless he wished to be killed, he must come and shake"
"hands with me and leave his arms behind. The Chief comes alone first,"
"and Carnehan shakes hands with him and whirls his arms about, same as"
"Dravot used, and very much surprised that Chief was, and strokes"
"my eyebrows. Then Carnehan goes alone to the Chief, and asks him in"
"dumb-show if he had an enemy he hated. â€˜I have,â  says the chief. So"
"Carnehan weeds out the pick of his men, and sets the two of the Army to"
"show them drill, and at the end of two weeks the men can manoeuvre about"
as well as Volunteers. So he marches with the Chief to a great big plain
"on the top of a mountain, and the Chiefâ s men rushes into a village and"
takes it; we three Martinis firing into the brown of the enemy. So we
"took that village too, and I gives the Chief a rag from my coat, and"
"says, â€˜Occupy till I come;â  which was scriptural. By way of a reminder,"
"when me and the Army was eighteen hundred yards away, I drops a bullet"
"near him standing on the snow, and all the people falls flat on their"
faces. Then I sends a letter to Dravot wherever he be by land or by
sea.â 

At the risk of throwing the creature out of train I interrupted: â How
could you write a letter up yonder?â 

"â The letter?--oh!--the letter! Keep looking at me between the eyes,"
"please. It was a string-talk letter, that weâ d learned the way of it"
from a blind beggar in the Punjab.â 

I remember that there had once come to the office a blind man with
"a knotted twig, and a piece of string which he wound round the twig"
"according to some cipher of his own. He could, after the lapse of days"
"or hours, repeat the sentence which he had reeled up. He had reduced the"
"alphabet to eleven primitive sounds, and tried to teach me his method,"
but I could not understand.

"â I sent that letter to Dravot,â  said Carnehan, â and told him to come"
back because this Kingdom was growing too big for me to handle; and then
"I struck for the first valley, to see how the priests were working. They"
"called the village we took along with the Chief, Bashkai, and the first"
"village we took, Er-Heb. The priests at Er-Heb was doing all right, but"
"they had a lot of pending cases about land to show me, and some men from"
another village had been firing arrows at night. I went out and looked
"for that village, and fired four rounds at it from a thousand yards."
"That used all the cartridges I cared to spend, and I waited for Dravot,"
"who had been away two or three months, and I kept my people quiet."

"â One morning I heard the devilâ s own noise of drums and horns, and Dan"
Dravot marches down the hill with his Army and a tail of hundreds of
"men, and, which was the most amazing, a great gold crown on his head."
"â€˜My Gord, Carnehan,â  says Daniel, â€˜this is a tremenjus business, and"
weâ ve got the whole country as far as itâ s worth having. I am the son
"of Alexander by Queen Semiramis, and youâ re my younger brother and a"
God too! Itâ s the biggest thing weâ ve ever seen. Iâ ve been marching and
"fighting for six weeks with the Army, and every footy little village for"
"fifty miles has come in rejoiceful; and more than that, Iâ ve got the key"
"of the whole show, as youâ ll see, and Iâ ve got a crown for you! I told"
"â€˜em to make two of â€˜em at a place called Shu, where the gold lies in the"
"rock like suet in mutton. Gold Iâ ve seen, and turquoise Iâ ve kicked out"
"of the cliffs, and thereâ s garnets in the sands of the river, and hereâ s"
"a chunk of amber that a man brought me. Call up all the priests and,"
"here, take your crown.â "

"â One of the men opens a black hair bag, and I slips the crown on. It was"
"too small and too heavy, but I wore it for the glory. Hammered gold it"
"was--five pounds weight, like a hoop of a barrel."

"â â€˜Peachey,â  says Dravot, â€˜we donâ t want to fight no more. The Craftâ s"
"the trick, so help me!â  and he brings forward that same Chief that I"
"left at Bashkai--Billy Fish we called him afterward, because he was so"
like Billy Fish that drove the big tank-engine at Mach on the Bolan in
"the old days. â€˜Shake hands with him,â  says Dravot; and I shook hands"
"and nearly dropped, for Billy Fish gave me the Grip. I said nothing, but"
"tried him with the Fellow-craft Grip. He answers all right, and I tried"
"the Masterâ s Grip, but that was a slip. â€˜A Fellow-craft he is!â  I says"
"to Dan. â€˜Does he know the word?â  â€˜He does,â  says Dan, â€˜and all the"
priests know. Itâ s a miracle! The Chiefs and the priests can work a
"Fellow-craft Lodge in a way thatâ s very like ours, and theyâ ve cut the"
"marks on the rocks, but they donâ t know the Third Degree, and theyâ ve"
come to find out. Itâ s Gordâ s Truth. Iâ ve known these long years that
"the Afghans knew up to the Fellow-craft Degree, but this is a miracle."
"A God and a Grand Master of the Craft am I, and a Lodge in the Third"
"Degree I will open, and weâ ll raise the head priests and the Chiefs of"
the villages.â 

"â â€˜Itâ s against all the law,â  I says, â€˜holding a Lodge without warrant"
from any one; and you know we never held office in any Lodge.â 

"â â€˜Itâ s a master stroke oâ  policy,â  says Dravot. â€˜It means running the"
country as easy as a four-wheeled bogie on a down grade. We canâ t stop
"to inquire now, or theyâ ll turn against us. Iâ ve forty Chiefs at my"
"heel, and passed and raised according to their merit they shall be."
"Billet these men on the villages, and see that we run up a Lodge of some"
kind. The temple of Imbra will do for a Lodge-room. The women must make
aprons as you show them. Iâ ll hold a levee of Chiefs to-night and Lodge
to-morrow.â 

"â I was fair run off my legs, but I wasnâ t such a fool as not to see what"
a pull this Craft business gave us. I showed the priestsâ  families how
"to make aprons of the degrees, but for Dravotâ s apron the blue border"
"and marks was made of turquoise lumps on white hide, not cloth. We took"
"a great square stone in the temple for the Masterâ s chair, and little"
"stones for the officerâ s chairs, and painted the black pavement with"
"white squares, and did what we could to make things regular."

â At the levee which was held that night on the hillside with big
"bonfires, Dravot gives out that him and me were Gods and sons of"
"Alexander, and Passed Grand Masters in the Craft, and was come to make"
Kafiristan a country where every man should eat in peace and drink in
"quiet, and specially obey us. Then the Chiefs come round to shake hands,"
and they were so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with
old friends. We gave them names according as they was like men we had
"known in India--Billy Fish, Holly Dilworth, Pikky Kergan, that was"
"Bazaar-master when I was at Mhow, and so on, and so on."

â  The  most amazing miracles was at Lodge next night. One of the old
"priests was watching us continuous, and I felt uneasy, for I knew weâ d"
"have to fudge the Ritual, and I didnâ t know what the men knew. The old"
priest was a stranger come in from beyond the village of Bashkai. The
minute Dravot puts on the Masterâ s apron that the girls had made for
"him, the priest fetches a whoop and a howl, and tries to overturn the"
"stone that Dravot was sitting on. â€˜Itâ s all up now,â  I says. â€˜That comes"
of meddling with the Craft without warrant!â  Dravot never winked an
"eye, not when ten priests took and tilted over the Grand Masterâ s"
"chair--which was to say, the stone of Imbra. The priest begins rubbing"
"the bottom end of it to clear away the black dirt, and presently he"
"shows all the other priests the Masterâ s Mark, same as was on Dravotâ s"
"apron, cut into the stone. Not even the priests of the temple of Imbra"
knew it was there. The old chap falls flat on his face at Dravotâ s feet
"and kisses â€˜em. â€˜Luck again,â  says Dravot, across the Lodge, to me;"
â€˜they say itâ s the missing Mark that no one could understand the why of.
Weâ re more than safe now.â  Then he bangs the butt of his gun for a gavel
"and says, â€˜By virtue of the authority vested in me by my own right"
"hand and the help of Peachey, I declare myself Grand Master of all"
"Freemasonry in Kafiristan in this the Mother Lodge oâ  the country, and"
King of Kafiristan equally with Peachey!â  At that he puts on his crown
"and I puts on mine,--I was doing Senior Warden,--and we opens the Lodge"
in most ample form. It was an amazing miracle! The priests moved in
"Lodge through the first two degrees almost without telling, as if the"
memory was coming back to them. After that Peachey and Dravot raised
such as was worthy--high priests and Chiefs of far-off villages. Billy
"Fish was the first, and I can tell you we scared the soul out of him."
"It was not in any way according to Ritual, but it served our turn. We"
"didnâ t raise more than ten of the biggest men, because we didnâ t want to"
make the Degree common. And they was clamouring to be raised.

"â â€˜In another six months,â  says Dravot, â€˜weâ ll hold another Communication"
"and see how you are working.â  Then he asks them about their villages,"
"and learns that they was fighting one against the other, and were sick"
and tired of it. And when they wasnâ t doing that they was fighting with
"the Mohammedans. â€˜You can fight those when they come into our country,â "
says Dravot. â€˜Tell off every tenth man of your tribes for a Frontier
"guard, and send two hundred at a time to this valley to be drilled."
"Nobody is going to be shot or speared any more so long as he does well,"
"and I know that you wonâ t cheat me, because youâ re white people--sons of"
"Alexander--and not like common black Mohammedans. You are  my  people,"
"and, by God,â  says he, running off into English at the end, â€˜Iâ ll make a"
"damned fine Nation of you, or Iâ ll die in the making!â "

"â I canâ t tell all we did for the next six months, because Dravot did a"
"lot I couldnâ t see the hang of, and he learned their lingo in a way I"
"never could. My work was to help the people plough, and now and again"
"go out with some of the Army and see what the other villages were doing,"
and make â€˜em throw rope bridges across the ravines which cut up the
"country horrid. Dravot was very kind to me, but when he walked up and"
down in the pine wood pulling that bloody red beard of his with both
"fists I knew he was thinking plans I could not advise about, and I just"
waited for orders.

â But Dravot never showed me disrespect before the people. They were
"afraid of me and the Army, but they loved Dan. He was the best of"
friends with the priests and the Chiefs; but any one could come across
"the hills with a complaint, and Dravot would hear him out fair, and call"
four priests together and say what was to be done. He used to call in
"Billy Fish from Bashkai, and Pikky Kergan from Shu, and an old Chief"
"we called Kafuzelum,--it was like enough to his real name,--and hold"
councils with â€˜em when there was any fighting to be done in small
"villages. That was his Council of War, and the four priests of Bashkai,"
"Shu, Khawak, and Madora was his Privy Council. Between the lot of â€˜em"
"they sent me, with forty men and twenty rifles, and sixty men carrying"
"turquoises, into the Ghorband country to buy those hand-made Martini"
"rifles, that come out of the Amirâ s workshops at Kabul, from one of the"
Amirâ s Herati regiments that would have sold the very teeth out of their
mouths for turquoises.

"â I stayed in Ghorband a month, and gave the Governor there the pick of"
"my baskets for hush-money, and bribed the Colonel of the regiment some"
"more, and, between the two and the tribes-people, we got more than a"
"hundred hand-made Martinis, a hundred good Kohat Jezails thatâ ll throw"
"to six hundred yards, and forty man-loads of very bad ammunition for the"
"rifles. I came back with what I had, and distributed â€˜em among the men"
that the Chiefs sent in to me to drill. Dravot was too busy to attend
"to those things, but the old Army that we first made helped me, and we"
"turned out five hundred men that could drill, and two hundred that knew"
"how to hold arms pretty straight. Even those cork-screwed, hand-made"
guns was a miracle to them. Dravot talked big about powder-shops and
"factories, walking up and down in the pine wood when the winter was"
coming on.

"â â€˜I wonâ t make a Nation,â  says he. â€˜Iâ ll make an Empire! These men"
arenâ t niggers; theyâ re English! Look at their eyes--look at their
mouths. Look at the way they stand up. They sit on chairs in their own
"houses. Theyâ re the Lost Tribes, or something like it, and theyâ ve grown"
to be English. Iâ ll take a census in the spring if the priests donâ t get
frightened. There must be a fair two million of â€˜em in these hills. The
villages are full oâ  little children. Two million people--two hundred
and fifty thousand fighting men--and all English! They only want the
"rifles and a little drilling. Two hundred and fifty thousand men, ready"
"to cut in on Russiaâ s right flank when she tries for India! Peachey,"
"man,â  he says, chewing his beard in great hunks, â€˜we shall be"
Emperors--Emperors of the Earth! Rajah Brooke will be a suckling to
us. Iâ ll treat with the Viceroy on equal terms. Iâ ll ask him to send me
twelve picked English--twelve that I know of--to help us govern a bit.
"Thereâ s Mackray, Serjeant Pensioner at Segowli--manyâ s the good dinner"
"heâ s given me, and his wife a pair of trousers. Thereâ s Donkin, the"
Warder of Tounghoo Jail; thereâ s hundreds that I could lay my hand on if
I was in India. The Viceroy shall do it for me; Iâ ll send a man through
"in the spring for those men, and Iâ ll write for a dispensation from"
the Grand Lodge for what Iâ ve done as Grand Master. That--and all the
Sniders thatâ ll be thrown out when the native troops in India take up
"the Martini. Theyâ ll be worn smooth, but theyâ ll do for fighting in"
"these hills. Twelve English, a hundred thousand Sniders run through the"
"Amirâ s country in driblets,--Iâ d be content with twenty thousand in one"
"year,--and weâ d be an Empire. When everything was shipshape Iâ d hand"
over the crown--this crown Iâ m wearing now--to Queen Victoria on my
"knees, and sheâ d say, â Rise up, Sir Daniel Dravot.â  Oh, itâ s big! Itâ s"
"big, I tell you! But thereâ s so much to be done in every place--Bashkai,"
"Khawak, Shu, and everywhere else.â "

â â€˜What is it?â  I says. â€˜There are no more men coming in to be drilled
this autumn. Look at those fat black clouds. Theyâ re bringing the snow.â 

"â â€˜It isnâ t that,â  says Daniel, putting his hand very hard on my"
"shoulder; â€˜and I donâ t wish to say anything thatâ s against you, for no"
other living man would have followed me and made me what I am as you
"have done. Youâ re a first-class Commander-in-Chief, and the people know"
"you; but--itâ s a big country, and somehow you canâ t help me, Peachey, in"
the way I want to be helped.â 

"â â€˜Go to your blasted priests, then!â  I said, and I was sorry when I made"
"that remark, but it did hurt me sore to find Daniel talking so superior,"
when Iâ d drilled all the men and done all he told me.

"â â€˜Donâ t letâ s quarrel, Peachey,â  says Daniel, without cursing. â€˜Youâ re"
"a King too, and the half of this Kingdom is yours; but canâ t you see,"
"Peachey, we want cleverer men than us now--three or four of â€˜em, that"
"we can scatter about for our Deputies. Itâ s a hugeous great State, and"
"I canâ t always tell the right thing to do, and I havenâ t time for all"
"I want to do, and hereâ s the winter coming on and all.â  He put half his"
"beard into his mouth, all red like the gold of his crown."

"â â€˜Iâ m sorry, Daniel,â  says I. â€˜Iâ ve done all I could. Iâ ve drilled"
the men and shown the people how to stack their oats better; and Iâ ve
brought in those tinware rifles from Ghorband--but I know what youâ re
driving at. I take it Kings always feel oppressed that way.â 

"â â€˜Thereâ s another thing too,â  says Dravot, walking up and down. â€˜The"
"winterâ s coming, and these people wonâ t be giving much trouble, and if"
they do we canâ t move about. I want a wife.â 

â â€˜For Gordâ s sake leave the women alone!â  I says. â€˜Weâ ve both got all
"the work we can, though I  am  a fool. Remember the Contrack, and keep"
clear oâ  women.â â 

â â€˜The Contrack only lasted till such time as we was Kings; and Kings
"we have been these months past,â  says Dravot, weighing his crown in his"
"hand. â€˜You go get a wife too, Peachey--a nice, strappinâ , plump girl"
thatâ ll keep you warm in the winter. Theyâ re prettier than English
"girls, and we can take the pick of â€˜em. Boil â€˜em once or twice in hot"
"water, and theyâ ll come out like chicken and ham.â "

"â â€˜Donâ t tempt me!â  I says. â€˜I will not have any dealings with a woman,"
not till we are a damâ  side more settled than we are now. Iâ ve been
"doing the work oâ  two men, and youâ ve been doing the work of three."
"Letâ s lie off a bit, and see if we can get some better tobacco from"
Afghan country and run in some good liquor; and no women.â â 

â â€˜Whoâ s talking oâ   women ?â  says Dravot. â€˜I said  wife --a Queen to
"breed a Kingâ s son for the King. A Queen out of the strongest tribe,"
"thatâ ll make them your blood-brothers, and thatâ ll lie by your side and"
tell you all the people thinks about you and their own affairs. Thatâ s
what I want.â 

â â€˜Do you remember that Bengali woman I kept at Mogul Serai when I was
a plate-layer?â  says I. â€˜A fat lot oâ  good she was to me. She taught me
the lingo and one or two other things; but what happened? She ran away
with the Station-masterâ s servant and half my monthâ s pay. Then
"she turned up at Dadur Junction in tow of a half-caste, and had the"
impidence to say I was her husband--all among the drivers in the
running-shed too!â 

"â â€˜Weâ ve done with that,â  says Dravot; â€˜these women are whiter than you"
"or me, and a Queen I will have for the winter months.â "

"â â€˜For the last time oâ  asking, Dan, do  not ,â  I says. â€˜Itâ ll only bring"
us harm. The Bible says that Kings ainâ t to waste their strength on
"women, â€˜specially when theyâ ve got a new raw Kingdom to work over.â "

"â â€˜For the last time of answering, I will,â  said Dravot, and he went away"
"through the pine-trees looking like a big red devil, the sun being on"
his crown and beard and all.

â But getting a wife was not as easy as Dan thought. He put it before the
"Council, and there was no answer till Billy Fish said that heâ d better"
ask the girls. Dravot damned them all round. â€˜Whatâ s wrong with me?â  he
"shouts, standing by the idol Imbra. â€˜Am I a dog, or am I not enough of"
a man for your wenches? Havenâ t I put the shadow of my hand over this
"country? Who stopped the last Afghan raid?â  It was me really, but Dravot"
was too angry to remember. â€˜Who bought your guns? Who repaired the
"bridges? Whoâ s the Grand Master of the sign cut in the stone?â  says he,"
"and he thumped his hand on the block that he used to sit on in Lodge,"
"and at Council, which opened like Lodge always. Billy Fish said nothing,"
"and no more did the others. â€˜Keep your hair on, Dan,â  said I, â€˜and ask"
"the girls. Thatâ s how itâ s done at Home, and these people are quite"
English.â 

"â â€˜The marriage of the King is a matter of State,â  says Dan, in a"
"white-hot rage, for he could feel, I hope, that he was going against"
"his better mind. He walked out of the Council-room, and the others sat"
"still, looking at the ground."

"â â€˜Billy Fish,â  says I to the Chief of Bashkai, â€˜whatâ s the difficulty"
here? A straight answer to a true friend.â 

"â â€˜You know,â  says Billy Fish. â€˜How should a man tell you who knows"
everything? How can daughters of men marry Gods or Devils? Itâ s not
proper.â 

"â I remembered something like that in the Bible; but, if after seeing us"
"as long as they had, they still believed we were Gods, it wasnâ t for me"
to undeceive them.

"â â€˜A God can do anything,â  says I. â€˜If the King is fond of a girl heâ ll"
"not let her die.â  â€˜Sheâ ll have to,â  said Billy Fish. â€˜There are all"
"sorts of Gods and Devils in these mountains, and now and again a girl"
"marries one of them and isnâ t seen any more. Besides, you two know the"
Mark cut in the stone. Only the Gods know that. We thought you were men
till you showed the sign of the Master.â 

â I wished then that we had explained about the loss of the genuine
secrets of a Master Mason at the first go-off; but I said nothing. All
that night there was a blowing of horns in a little dark temple half-way
"down the hill, and I heard the girl crying fit to die. One of the"
priests told us that she was being prepared to marry the King.

"â â€˜Iâ ll have no nonsense of that kind,â  says Dan. â€˜I donâ t want to"
"interfere with your customs, but Iâ ll take my own wife.â  â€˜The girlâ s a"
"little bit afraid,â  says the priest. â€˜She thinks sheâ s going to die, and"
they are a-heartening of her up down in the temple.â 

"â â€˜Hearten her very tender, then,â  says Dravot, â€˜or Iâ ll hearten you with"
the butt of a gun so youâ ll never want to be heartened again.â  He licked
"his lips, did Dan, and stayed up walking about more than half the night,"
thinking of the wife that he was going to get in the morning. I wasnâ t
"any means comfortable, for I knew that dealings with a woman in foreign"
"parts, though you was a crowned King twenty times over, could not but be"
"risky. I got up very early in the morning while Dravot was asleep, and"
"I saw the priests talking together in whispers, and the Chiefs talking"
"together too, and they looked at me out of the corners of their eyes."

"â â€˜What is up, Fish?â  I say to the Bashkai man, who was wrapped up in his"
furs and looking splendid to behold.

"â â€˜I canâ t rightly say,â  says he; â€˜but if you can make the King drop all"
"this nonsense about marriage, youâ ll be doing him and me and yourself a"
great service.â 

"â â€˜That I do believe,â  says I. â€˜But sure, you know, Billy, as well as me,"
"having fought against and for us, that the King and me are nothing more"
"than two of the finest men that God Almighty ever made. Nothing more, I"
do assure you.â 

"â â€˜That may be,â  says Billy Fish, â€˜and yet I should be sorry if it was.â "
He sinks his head upon his great fur cloak for a minute and thinks.
"â€˜King,â  says he, â€˜be you man or God or Devil, Iâ ll stick by you to-day."
"I have twenty of my men with me, and they will follow me. Weâ ll go to"
Bashkai until the storm blows over.â 

"â A little snow had fallen in the night, and everything was white except"
the greasy fat clouds that blew down and down from the north. Dravot
"came out with his crown on his head, swinging his arms and stamping his"
"feet, and looking more pleased than Punch."

"â â€˜For the last time, drop it, Dan,â  says I, in a whisper; â€˜Billy Fish"
here says that there will be a row.â 

"â â€˜A row among my people!â  says Dravot. â€˜Not much. Peachey, youâ re a fool"
"not to get a wife too. Whereâ s the girl?â  says he, with a voice as loud"
"as the braying of a jackass. â€˜Call up all the Chiefs and priests, and"
let the Emperor see if his wife suits him.â 

â There was no need to call any one. They were all there leaning on their
guns and spears round the clearing in the centre of the pine wood. A lot
"of priests went down to the little temple to bring up the girl, and the"
horns blew fit to wake the dead. Billy Fish saunters round and gets as
"close to Daniel as he could, and behind him stood his twenty men with"
"matchlocks--not a man of them under six feet. I was next to Dravot, and"
"behind me was twenty men of the regular Army. Up comes the girl, and a"
"strapping wench she was, covered with silver and turquoises, but white"
"as death, and looking back every minute at the priests."

"â â€˜Sheâ ll do,â  said Dan, looking her over. â€˜Whatâ s to be afraid of, lass?"
"Come and kiss me.â  He puts his arm round her. She shuts her eyes,"
"gives a bit of a squeak, and down goes her face in the side of Danâ s"
flaming-red beard.

"â â€˜The slutâ s bitten me!â  says he, clapping his hand to his neck, and,"
"sure enough, his hand was red with blood. Billy Fish and two of his"
matchlock men catches hold of Dan by the shoulders and drags him into
"the Bashkai lot, while the priests howls in their lingo, â€˜Neither God"
"nor Devil, but a man!â  I was all taken aback, for a priest cut at me in"
"front, and the Army behind began firing into the Bashkai men."

"â â€˜God Aâ mighty!â  says Dan, â€˜what is the meaning oâ  this?â "

â â€˜Come back! Come away!â  says Billy Fish. â€˜Ruin and Mutiny is the
matter. Weâ ll break for Bashkai if we can.â 

"â I tried to give some sort of orders to my men,--the men oâ  the regular"
"Army,--but it was no use, so I fired into the brown of â€˜em with an"
English Martini and drilled three beggars in a line. The valley was full
"of shouting, howling creatures, and every soul was shrieking, â€˜Not a God"
"nor a Devil, but only a man!â  The Bashkai troops stuck to Billy Fish all"
"they were worth, but their matchlocks wasnâ t half as good as the Kabul"
"breech-loaders, and four of them dropped. Dan was bellowing like a bull,"
for he was very wrathy; and Billy Fish had a hard job to prevent him
running out at the crowd.

"â â€˜We canâ t stand,â  says Billy Fish. â€˜Make a run for it down the valley!"
"The whole place is against us.â  The matchlock-men ran, and we went down"
the valley in spite of Dravot. He was swearing horrible and crying
"out that he was a King. The priests rolled great stones on us, and"
"the regular Army fired hard, and there wasnâ t more than six men, not"
"counting Dan, Billy Fish, and Me, that came down to the bottom of the"
valley alive.

"â Then they stopped firing, and the horns in the temple blew again. â€˜Come"
away--for Gordâ s sake come away!â  says Billy Fish. â€˜Theyâ ll send runners
out to all the villages before ever we get to Bashkai. I can protect you
"there, but I canâ t do anything now.â "

â My own notion is that Dan began to go mad in his head from that hour.
He stared up and down like a stuck pig. Then he was all for walking back
alone and killing the priests with his bare hands; which he could have
"done. â€˜An Emperor am I,â  says Daniel, â€˜and next year I shall be a Knight"
of the Queen.â 

"â â€˜All right, Dan,â  says I; â€˜but come along now while thereâ s time.â "

"â â€˜Itâ s your fault,â  says he, â€˜for not looking after your Army better."
"There was mutiny in the midst, and you didnâ t know--you damned"
"engine-driving, plate-laying, missionaryâ s-pass-hunting hound!â  He sat"
upon a rock and called me every foul name he could lay tongue to. I was
"too heart-sick to care, though it was all his foolishness that brought"
the smash.

"â â€˜Iâ m sorry, Dan,â  says I, â€˜but thereâ s no accounting for natives. This"
"business is our Fifty-seven. Maybe weâ ll make something out of it yet,"
when weâ ve got to Bashkai.â 

"â â€˜Letâ s get to Bashkai, then,â  says Dan, â€˜and, by God, when I come"
back here again Iâ ll sweep the valley so there isnâ t a bug in a blanket
left!â 

"â We walked all that day, and all that night Dan was stumping up and down"
"on the snow, chewing his beard and muttering to himself."

"â â€˜Thereâ s no hope oâ  getting clear,â  said Billy Fish. â€˜The priests have"
sent runners to the villages to say that you are only men. Why didnâ t
"you stick on as Gods till things was more settled? Iâ m a dead man,â  says"
"Billy Fish, and he throws himself down on the snow and begins to pray to"
his Gods.

"â Next morning we was in a cruel bad country--all up and down, no level"
"ground at all, and no food, either. The six Bashkai men looked at Billy"
"Fish hungry-way as if they wanted to ask something, but they never said"
a word. At noon we came to the top of a flat mountain all covered with
"snow, and when we climbed up into it, behold, there was an Army in"
position waiting in the middle!

"â â€˜The runners have been very quick,â  says Billy Fish, with a little bit"
of a laugh. â€˜They are waiting for us.â 

"â Three or four men began to fire from the enemyâ s side, and a chance"
shot took Daniel in the calf of the leg. That brought him to his senses.
"He looks across the snow at the Army, and sees the rifles that we had"
brought into the country.

"â â€˜Weâ re done for,â  says he. â€˜They are Englishmen, these people,--and"
"itâ s my blasted nonsense that has brought you to this. Get back, Billy"
"Fish, and take your men away; youâ ve done what you could, and now cut"
"for it. Carnehan,â  says he, â€˜shake hands with me and go along with"
Billy. Maybe they wonâ t kill you. Iâ ll go and meet â€˜em alone. Itâ s me
"that did it! Me, the King!â "

"â â€˜Go!â  says I. â€˜Go to Hell, Dan! Iâ m with you here. Billy Fish, you"
"clear out, and we two will meet those folk.â "

"â â€˜Iâ m a Chief,â  says Billy Fish, quite quiet. â€˜I stay with you. My men"
can go.â 

"â The Bashkai fellows didnâ t wait for a second word, but ran off, and Dan"
and Me and Billy Fish walked across to where the drums were drumming and
the horns were horning. It was cold--awful cold. Iâ ve got that cold in
the back of my head now. Thereâ s a lump of it there.â 

The punka-coolies had gone to sleep. Two kerosene lamps were blazing in
"the office, and the perspiration poured down my face and splashed on the"
"blotter as I leaned forward. Carnehan was shivering, and I feared that"
"his mind might go. I wiped my face, took a fresh grip of the piteously"
"mangled hands, and said, â What happened after that?â "

The momentary shift of my eyes had broken the clear current.

â What was you pleased to say?â  whined Carnehan. â They took them without
"any sound. Not a little whisper all along the snow, not though the King"
knocked down the first man that set hand on him--not though old Peachey
fired his last cartridge into the brown of â€˜em. Not a single solitary
"sound did those swines make. They just closed up tight, and I tell you"
"their furs stunk. There was a man called Billy Fish, a good friend of us"
"all, and they cut his throat, Sir, then and there, like a pig; and the"
"King kicks up the bloody snow and says, â€˜Weâ ve had a dashed fine run for"
"our money. Whatâ s coming next?â  But Peachey, Peachey Taliaferro, I tell"
"you, Sir, in confidence as betwixt two friends, he lost his head, Sir."
"No, he didnâ t, neither. The King lost his head, so he did, all along oâ "
"one of those cunning rope bridges. Kindly let me have the paper-cutter,"
Sir. It tilted this way. They marched him a mile across that snow to a
rope bridge over a ravine with a river at the bottom. You may have seen
such. They prodded him behind like an ox. â€˜Damn your eyes!â  says
the King. â€˜Dâ  you suppose I canâ t die like a gentleman?â  He turns to
Peachey--Peachey that was crying like a child. â€˜Iâ ve brought you to
"this, Peachey,â  says he. â€˜Brought you out of your happy life to be"
"killed in Kafiristan, where you was late Commander-in-Chief of the"
"Emperorâ s forces. Say you forgive me, Peachey.â  â€˜I do,â  says Peachey."
"â€˜Fully and freely do I forgive you, Dan.â  â€˜Shake hands, Peachey,â  says"
"he. â€˜Iâ m going now.â  Out he goes, looking neither right nor left, and"
"when he was plumb in the middle of those dizzy dancing ropes, â€˜Cut you"
"beggars,â  he shouts; and they cut, and old Dan fell, turning round and"
"round and round, twenty thousand miles, for he took half an hour to fall"
"till he struck the water, and I could see his body caught on a rock with"
the gold crown close beside.

â But do you know what they did to Peachey between two pine-trees? They
"crucified him, Sir, as Peacheyâ s hand will show. They used wooden pegs"
"for his hands and feet; but he didnâ t die. He hung there and screamed,"
"and they took him down next day, and said it was a miracle that he"
wasnâ t dead. They took him down--poor old Peachey that hadnâ t done them
any harm--that hadnâ t done them any--â 

"He rocked to and fro and wept bitterly, wiping his eyes with the back of"
his scarred hands and moaning like a child for some ten minutes.

"â They was cruel enough to feed him up in the temple, because they said"
he was more of a God than old Daniel that was a man. Then they turned
"him out on the snow, and told him to go home, and Peachey came home in"
"about a year, begging along the roads quite safe; for Daniel Dravot he"
"walked before and said, â€˜Come along, Peachey. Itâ s a big thing weâ re"
"doing.â  The mountains they danced at night, and the mountains they tried"
"to fall on Peacheyâ s head, but Dan he held up his hand, and Peachey came"
"along bent double. He never let go of Danâ s hand, and he never let go"
"of Danâ s head. They gave it to him as a present in the temple, to remind"
him not to come again; and though the crown was pure gold and Peachey
"was starving, never would Peachey sell the same. You know Dravot, Sir!"
You knew Right Worshipful Brother Dravot! Look at him now!â 

He fumbled in the mass of rags round his bent waist; brought out a black
horsehair bag embroidered with silver thread; and shook therefrom on to
"my table--the dried, withered head of Daniel Dravot! The morning sun,"
"that had long been paling the lamps, struck the red beard and blind"
"sunken eyes; struck, too, a heavy circlet of gold studded with raw"
"turquoises, that Carnehan placed tenderly on the battered temples."

"â You beâ old now,â  said Carnehan, â the Emperor in his â€˜abit as he"
lived--the King of Kafiristan with his crown upon his head. Poor old
Daniel that was a monarch once!â 

"I shuddered, for, in spite of defacements manifold, I recognised the"
head of the man of Marwar Junction. Carnehan rose to go. I attempted to
"stop him. He was not fit to walk abroad. â Let me take away the whisky,"
"and give me a little money,â  he gasped. â I was a King once. Iâ ll go to"
the Deputy Commissioner and ask to set in the Poorhouse till I get my
"health. No, thank you, I canâ t wait till you get a carriage for me. Iâ ve"
urgent private affairs--in the south--at Marwar.â 

He shambled out of the office and departed in the direction of the
Deputy Commissionerâ s house. That day at noon I had occasion to go down
"the blinding-hot Mall, and I saw a crooked man crawling along the white"
"dust of the roadside, his hat in his hand, quavering dolorously after"
"the fashion of street-singers at Home. There was not a soul in sight,"
and he was out of all possible earshot of the houses. And he sang
"through his nose, turning his head from right to left:"

"â The Son of Man goes forth to war,"
A golden crown to gain;
His blood-red banner streams afar--
Who follows in His train?â 

"I waited to hear no more, but put the poor wretch into my carriage and"
drove him off to the nearest missionary for eventual transfer to the
"Asylum. He repeated the hymn twice while he was with me, whom he did not"
"in the least recognise, and I left him singing it to the missionary."

Two days later I inquired after his welfare of the Superintendent of the
Asylum.

â He was admitted suffering from sunstroke. He died early yesterday
"morning,â  said the Superintendent. â Is it true that he was half an hour"
bareheaded in the sun at midday?â 

"â Yes,â  said I; â but do you happen to know if he had anything upon him by"
any chance when he died?â 

"â Not to my knowledge,â  said the Superintendent."

And there the matter rests.




â THE FINEST STORY IN THE WORLDâ 

â Oâ  ever the knightly years were gone
"With the old world to the grave,"
I was a king in Babylon
And you were a Christian slave.â 
#NAME?

His name was Charlie Mears; he was the only son of his mother who was a
"widow, and he lived in the north of London, coming into the City"
every day to work in a bank. He was twenty years old and suffered from
aspirations. I met him in a public billiard-saloon where the marker
"called him by his given name, and he called the marker â Bulls-eyes.â "
"Charley explained, a little nervously, that he had only come to the"
"place to look on, and since looking on at games of skill is not a cheap"
"amusement for the young, I suggested that Charlie should go back to his"
mother.

That was our first step toward better acquaintance. He would call on
me sometimes in the evenings instead of running about London with his
"fellow-clerks; and before long, speaking of himself as a young man must,"
"he told me of his aspirations, which were all literary. He desired to"
"make himself an undying name chiefly through verse, though he was not"
above sending stories of love and death to the drop-a-penny-in-the-slot
journals. It was my fate to sit still while Charlie read me poems of
"many hundred lines, and bulky fragments of plays that would surely"
"shake the world. My reward was his unreserved confidence, and the"
self-revelations and troubles of a young man are almost as holy as those
"of a maiden. Charlie had never fallen in love, but was anxious to do so"
on the first opportunity; he believed in all things good and all things
"honorable, but, at the same time, was curiously careful to let me"
see that he knew his way about the world as befitted a bank clerk on
twenty-five shillings a week. He rhymed â doveâ  with â loveâ  and â moonâ 
"with â June,â  and devoutly believed that they had never so been rhymed"
before. The long lame gaps in his plays he filled up with hasty words of
"apology and description and swept on, seeing all that he intended to"
"do so clearly that he esteemed it already done, and turned to me for"
applause.

"I fancy that his mother did not encourage his aspirations, and I know"
that his writing-table at home was the edge of his washstand. This he
told me almost at the outset of our acquaintance; when he was ravaging
"my bookshelves, and a little before I was implored to speak the truth"
"as to his chances of â writing something really great, you know.â  Maybe"
"I encouraged him too much, for, one night, he called on me, his eyes"
"flaming with excitement, and said breathlessly:"

â Do you mind--can you let me stay here and write all this evening? I
"wonâ t interrupt you, I wonâ t really. Thereâ s no place for me to write in"
at my motherâ s.â 

"â Whatâ s the trouble?â  I said, knowing well what that trouble was."

â Iâ ve a notion in my head that would make the most splendid story that
was ever written. Do let me write it out here. Itâ s  such  a notion!â 

There was no resisting the appeal. I set him a table; he hardly
"thanked me, but plunged into the work at once. For half an hour the pen"
scratched without stopping. Then Charlie sighed and tugged his hair. The
"scratching grew slower, there were more erasures, and at last ceased."
The finest story in the world would not come forth.

"â It looks such awful rot nowâ  he said, mournfully. â And yet it seemed so"
good when I was thinking about it. Whatâ s wrong?â 

I could not dishearten him by saying the truth. So I answered: â Perhaps
you donâ t feel in the mood for writing.â 

â Yes I do--except when I look at this stuff. Ugh!â 

"â Read me what youâ ve done,â  I said. He read, and it was wondrous bad"
"and he paused at all the specially turgid sentences, expecting a little"
"approval; for he was proud of those sentences, as I knew he would be."

"â It needs compression,â  I suggested, cautiously."

â I hate cutting my things down. I donâ t think you could alter a word
here without spoiling the sense. It reads better aloud than when I was
writing it.â 

"â Charlie, youâ re suffering from an alarming disease afflicting a"
"numerous class. Put the thing by, and tackle it again in a week.â "

â I want to do it at once. What do you think of it?â 

â How can I judge from a half-written tale? Tell me the story as it lies
in your head.â 

"Charlie told, and in the telling there was everything that his ignorance"
had so carefully prevented from escaping into the written word. I looked
"at him, and wondering whether it were possible, that he did not know the"
"originality, the power of the notion that had come in his way? It was"
distinctly a Notion among notions. Men had been puffed up with pride by
notions not a tithe as excellent and practicable. But Charlie babbled
"on serenely, interrupting the current of pure fancy with samples of"
horrible sentences that he purposed to use. I heard him out to the end.
"It would be folly to allow his idea to remain in his own inept hands,"
"when I could do so much with it. Not all that could be done indeed; but,"
oh so much!

"â What do you think?â  he said, at last. â I fancy I shall call it â€˜The"
Story of a Ship.â â 

â I think the ideaâ s pretty good; but you wonâ t be able to handle it for
ever so long. Now I----â 

â Would it be of any use to you? Would you care to take it? I should be
"proud,â  said Charlie, promptly."

"There are few things sweeter in this world than the guileless,"
"hot-headed, intemperate, open admiration of a junior. Even a woman in"
"her blindest devotion does not fall into the gait of the man she adores,"
"tilt her bonnet to the angle at which he wears his hat, or interlard her"
speech with his pet oaths. And Charlie did all these things. Still
it was necessary to salve my conscience before I possessed myself of
Charlieâ s thoughts.

"â Letâ s make a bargain. Iâ ll give you a fiver for the notion,â  I said."
Charlie became a bank-clerk at once.

"â Oh, thatâ s impossible. Between two pals, you know, if I may call you"
"so, and speaking as a man of the world, I couldnâ t. Take the notion if"
itâ s any use to you. Iâ ve heaps more.â 

He had--none knew this better than I--but they were the notions of other
men.

"â Look at it as a matter of business-between men of the world,â  I"
returned. â Five pounds will buy you any number of poetry-books. Business
"is business, and you may be sure I shouldnâ t give that price unless----â "

"â Oh, if you put it  that  way,â  said Charlie, visibly moved by the"
thought of the books. The bargain was clinched with an agreement that
he should at unstated intervals come to me with all the notions that he
"possessed, should have a table of his own to write at, and unquestioned"
right to inflict upon me all his poems and fragments of poems. Then I
"said, â Now tell me how you came by this idea.â "

â It came by itself.â  Charlieâ s eyes opened a little.

"â Yes, but you told me a great deal about the hero that you must have"
read before somewhere.â 

"â I havenâ t any time for reading, except when you let me sit here, and"
on Sundays Iâ m on my bicycle or down the river all day. Thereâ s nothing
"wrong about the hero, is there?â "

â Tell me again and I shall understand clearly. You say that your hero
went pirating. How did he live?â 

â He was on the lower deck of this ship-thing that I was telling you
about.â 

â What sort of ship?â 

"â It was the kind rowed with oars, and the sea spurts through the"
oar-holes and the men row sitting up to their knees in water. Then
thereâ s a bench running down between the two lines of oars and an
overseer with a whip walks up and down the bench to make the men work.â 

â How do you know that?â 

"â Itâ s in the tale. Thereâ s a rope running overhead, looped to the upper"
"deck, for the overseer to catch hold of when the ship rolls. When the"
"overseer misses the rope once and falls among the rowers, remember the"
hero laughs at him and gets licked for it. Heâ s chained to his oar of
course--the hero.â 

â How is he chained?â 

"â With an iron band round his waist fixed to the bench he sits on, and a"
sort of handcuff on his left wrist chaining him to the oar. Heâ s on the
"lower deck where the worst men are sent, and the only light comes from"
the hatchways and through the oar-holes. Canâ t you imagine the sunlight
just squeezing through between the handle and the hole and wobbling
about as the ship moves?â 

"â I can, but I canâ t imagine your imagining it.â "

â How could it be any other way? Now you listen to me. The long oars on
"the upper deck are managed by four men to each bench, the lower ones"
"by three, and the lowest of all by two. Remember itâ s quite dark on the"
lowest deck and all the men there go mad. When a man dies at his oar
"on that deck he isnâ t thrown overboard, but cut up in his chains and"
stuffed through the oar-hole in little pieces.â 

"â Why?â  I demanded, amazed, not so much at the information as the tone of"
command in which it was flung out.

â To save trouble and to frighten the others. It needs two overseers to
drag a manâ s body up to the top deck; and if the men at the lower deck
"oars were left alone, of course theyâ d stop rowing and try to pull up"
the benches by all standing up together in their chains.â 

â Youâ ve a most provident imagination. Where have you been reading about
galleys and galley-slaves?â 

"â Nowhere that I remember. I row a little when I get the chance. But,"
"perhaps, if you say so, I may have read something.â "

"He went away shortly afterward to deal with booksellers, and I wondered"
how a bank clerk aged twenty could put into my hands with a profligate
"abundance of detail, all given with absolute assurance, the story of"
"extravagant and bloodthirsty adventure, riot, piracy, and death in"
unnamed seas. He had led his hero a desperate dance through revolt
"against the overseas, to command of a ship of his own, and ultimate"
"establishment of a kingdom on an island â somewhere in the sea, you"
"knowâ ; and, delighted with my paltry five pounds, had gone out to buy"
"the notions of other men, that these might teach him how to write. I"
had the consolation of knowing that this notion was mine by right of
"purchase, and I thought that I could make something of it."

When next he came to me he was drunk--royally drunk on many poets for
"the first time revealed to him. His pupils were dilated, his words"
"tumbled over each other, and he wrapped himself in quotations. Most of"
all was he drunk with Longfellow.

"â Isnâ t it splendid? Isnâ t it superb?â  he cried, after hasty greetings."
â Listen to this--

"â â€˜Wouldst thou,â  so the helmsman answered,"
â€˜Know the secret of the sea?
Only those who brave its dangers
Comprehend its mystery.â 

By gum!

â â€˜Only those who brave its dangers
Comprehend its mystery.â â 

"he repeated twenty times, walking up and down the room and forgetting"
"me. â But I can understand it too,â  he said to himself. â I donâ t know how"
to thank you for that fiver. And this; listen--

â â€˜I remember the black wharves and the ships
"And the sea-tides tossing free,"
"And the Spanish sailors with bearded lips,"
"And the beauty and mystery of the ships,"
And the magic of the sea.â 

"â I havenâ t braved any dangers, but I feel as if I knew all about it.â "

â You certainly seem to have a grip of the sea. Have you ever seen it?â 

â When I was a little chap I went to Brighton once; we used to live in
"Coventry, though, before we came to London. I never saw it,"

â€˜When descends on the Atlantic
The gigantic
Storm-wind of the Equinox.â â 

He shook me by the shoulder to make me understand the passion that was
shaking himself.

"â When that storm comes,â  he continued, â I think that all the oars in"
"the ship that I was talking about get broken, and the rowers have their"
"chests smashed in by the bucking oar-heads. By the way, have you done"
anything with that notion of mine yet?â 

â No. I was waiting to hear more of it from you. Tell me how in the world
you re so certain about the fittings of the ship. You know nothing of
ships.â 

â I donâ t know. Itâ s as real as anything to me until I try to write it
"down. I was thinking about it only last night in bed, after you had"
loaned me â€˜Treasure Islandâ ; and I made up a a whole lot of new things
to go into the story.â 

â What sort of things?â 

â About the food the men ate; rotten figs and black beans and wine in a
"skin bag, passed from bench to bench.â "

â Was the ship built so long ago as  that ?â 

â As what? I donâ t know whether it was long ago or not. Itâ s only a
"notion, but sometimes it seems just as real as if it was true. Do I"
bother you with talking about it?â 

â Not in the least. Did you make up anything else?â 

"â Yes, but itâ s nonsense.â  Charlie flushed a little."

â Never mind; letâ s hear about it.â 

"â Well, I was thinking over the story, and after awhile I got out of bed"
and wrote down on a piece of paper the sort of stuff the men might be
supposed to scratch on their oars with the edges of their handcuffs. It
"seemed to make the thing more lifelike. It is so real to me, yâ know.â "

â Have you the paper on you?â 

"â Ye--es, but whatâ s the use of showing it? Itâ s only a lot of scratches."
"All the same, we might have â€˜em reproduced in the book on the front"
page.â 

â Iâ ll attend to those details. Show me what your men wrote.â 

"He pulled out of his pocket a sheet of note-paper, with a single line of"
"scratches upon it, and I put this carefully away."

â What is it supposed to mean in English?â  I said.

"â Oh, I donâ t know. Perhaps it means â€˜Iâ m beastly tired.â  Itâ s great"
"nonsence,â  he repeated, â but all those men in the ship seem as real"
people to me. Do do something to the notion soon; I should like to see
it written and printed.â 

â But all youâ ve told me would make a long book.â 

â Make it then. Youâ ve only to sit down and write it out.â 

â Give me a little time. Have you any more notions?â 

â Not just now. Iâ m reading all the books Iâ ve bought. Theyâ re splendid.â 

When he had left I looked at the sheet of note-paper with the
"inscription upon it. Then I took my head tenderly between both hands,"
to make certain that it was not coming off or turning round. Then...
but there seemed to be no interval between quitting my rooms and finding
myself arguing with a policeman outside a door marked Private in a
"corridor of the British Museum. All I demanded, as politely as possible,"
was â the Greek antiquity man.â  The policeman knew nothing except the
"rules of the Museum, and it became necessary to forage through all the"
houses and offices inside the gates. An elderly gentleman called away
from his lunch put an end to my search by holding the note-paper between
finger and thumb and sniffing at it scornfully.

"â What does this mean? Hâ mm,â  said he. â So far as I can ascertain it is"
an attempt to write extremely corrupt Greek on the partâ --here he glared
at me with intention--â of an extremely illiterate-ah-person.â  He read
"slowly from the paper, â Pollock, Erckman, Tauchnitz, Hennikerâ --four"
names familiar to me.

â Can you tell me what the corruption is supposed to mean--the gist of
the thing?â  I asked.

â I have been--many times--overcome with weariness in this particular
"employment. That is the meaning.â  He returned me the paper, and I fled"
"without a word of thanks, explanation, or apology."

I might have been excused for forgetting much. To me of all men had been
"given the chance to write the most marvelous tale in the world, nothing"
"less than the story of a Greek galley-slave, as told by himself. Small"
wonder that his dreaming had seemed real to Charlie. The Fates that are
"so careful to shut the doors of each successive life behind us had, in"
"this case, been neglectful, and Charlie was looking, though that he did"
"not know, where never man had been permitted to look with full knowledge"
since Time began. Above all he was absolutely ignorant of the knowledge
"sold to me for five pounds; and he would retain that ignorance, for"
"bank-clerks do not understand metempsychosis, and a sound commercial"
education does not include Greek. He would supply me--here I capered
among the dumb gods of Egypt and laughed in their battered faces--with
material to make my tale sure--so sure that the world would hail it as
an impudent and vamped fiction. And I--I alone would know that it was
absolutely and literally true. I--I alone held this jewel to my hand for
the cutting and polishing. Therefore I danced again among the gods till
a policeman saw me and took steps in my direction.

"It remained now only to encourage Charlie to talk, and here there was no"
difficulty. But I had forgotten those accursed books of poetry. He came
"to me time after time, as useless as a surcharged phonograph--drunk on"
"Byron, Shelley, or Keats. Knowing now what the boy had been in his past"
"lives, and desperately anxious not to lose one word of his babble, I"
could not hide from him my respect and interest. He misconstrued both
"into respect for the present soul of Charlie Mears, to whom life was as"
"new as it was to Adam, and interest in his readings; and stretched my"
"patience to breaking point by reciting poetry--not his own now, but"
that of others. I wished every English poet blotted out of the memory of
mankind. I blasphemed the mightiest names of song because they had drawn
"Charlie from the path of direct narrative, and would, later, spur him to"
imitate them; but I choked down my impatience until the first flood of
enthusiasm should have spent itself and the boy returned to his dreams.

"â Whatâ s the use of my telling you what  I  think, when these chaps wrote"
"things for the angels to read?â  he growled, one evening. â Why donâ t you"
write something like theirs?â 

"â I donâ t think youâ re treating me quite fairly,â  I said, speaking under"
strong restraint.

"â Iâ ve given you the story,â  he said, shortly replunging into â Lara.â "

â But I want the details.â 

â The things I make up about that damned ship that you call a galley?
Theyâ re quite easy. You can just make â€˜em up yourself. Turn up the gas a
"little, I want to go on reading.â "

I could have broken the gas globe over his head for his amazing
stupidity. I could indeed make up things for myself did I only know what
Charlie did not know that he knew. But since the doors were shut behind
me I could only wait his youthful pleasure and strive to keep him
in good temper. One minuteâ s want of guard might spoil a priceless
revelation: now and again he would toss his books aside--he kept them
"in my rooms, for his mother would have been shocked at the waste of"
good money had she seen them--and launched into his sea dreams. Again I
cursed all the poets of England. The plastic mind of the bank-clerk had
"been overlaid, colored and distorted by that which he had read, and the"
result as delivered was a confused tangle of other voices most like the
muttered song through a City telephone in the busiest part of the day.

He talked of the galley--his own galley had he but known it--with
illustrations borrowed from the â Bride of Abydos.â  He pointed the
"experiences of his hero with quotations from â The Corsair,â  and threw"
"in deep and desperate moral reflections from â Cainâ  and â Manfred,â "
expecting me to use them all. Only when the talk turned on Longfellow
"were the jarring cross-currents dumb, and I knew that Charlie was"
speaking the truth as he remembered it.

"â What do you think of this?â  I said one evening, as soon as I understood"
"the medium in which his memory worked best, and, before he could"
expostulate read him the whole of â The Saga of King Olaf!â 

"He listened open-mouthed, flushed his hands drumming on the back of the"
"sofa where he lay, till I came to the Songs of Emar Tamberskelver and"
the verse:

"â Emar then, the arrow taking"
"From the loosened string,"
Answered: â€˜That was Norway breaking
"â€˜Neath thy hand, O King.â â "

He gasped with pure delight of sound.

"â Thatâ s better than Byron, a little,â  I ventured."

â Better? Why itâ s true! How could he have known?â 

I went back and repeated:

"â â€˜What was that?â  said Olaf, standing"
"On the quarter-deck,"
â€˜Something heard I like the stranding
Of a shattered wreck.â â 

â How could he have known how the ships crash and the oars rip out and
go  z-zzp  all along the line? Why only the other night.... But go back
please and read â€˜The Skerry of Shrieksâ  again.â 

"â No, Iâ m tired. Letâ s talk. What happened the other night?â "

â I had an awful nightmare about that galley of ours. I dreamed I was
drowned in a fight. You see we ran alongside another ship in harbor. The
water was dead still except where our oars whipped it up. You know where
"I always sit in the galley?â  He spoke haltingly at first, under a fine"
English fear of being laughed at.

"â No. Thatâ s news to me,â  I answered, meekly, my heart beginning to beat."

â On the fourth oar from the bow on the right side on the upper deck.
"There were four of us at the oar, all chained. I remember watching the"
water and trying to get my handcuffs off before the row began. Then we
"closed up on the other ship, and all their fighting men jumped over our"
"bulwarks, and my bench broke and I was pinned down with the three other"
"fellows on top of me, and the big oar jammed across our backs.â "

â Well?â  Charlieâ s eyes were alive and alight. He was looking at the wall
behind my chair.

"â I donâ t know how we fought. The men were trampling all over my back,"
"and I lay low. Then our rowers on the left side--tied to their oars, you"
"know--began to yell and back water. I could hear the water sizzle, and"
"we spun round like a cockchafer and I knew, lying where I was, that"
"there was a galley coming up bow-on, to ram us on the left side. I could"
just lift up my head and see her sail over the bulwarks. We wanted to
"meet her bow to bow, but it was too late. We could only turn a little"
bit because the galley on our right had hooked herself on to us and
"stopped our moving. Then, by gum! there was a crash! Our left oars began"
"to break as the other galley, the moving one yâ know, stuck her nose into"
"them. Then the lower-deck oars shot up through the deck-planking, but"
"first, and one of them jumped clean up into the air and came down again"
close to my head.â 

â How was that managed?â 

â The moving galleyâ s bow was plunking them back through their own
"oarholes, and I could hear the devil of a shindy in the decks below."
"Then her nose caught us nearly in the middle, and we tilted sideways,"
and the fellows in the right-hand galley unhitched their hooks and
"ropes, and threw things on to our upper deck--arrows, and hot pitch or"
"something that stung, and we went up and up and up on the left side,"
"and the right side dipped, and I twisted my head round and saw the water"
"stand still as it topped the right bulwarks, and then it curled over and"
"crashed down on the whole lot of us on the right side, and I felt it hit"
"my back, and I woke.â "

"â One minute, Charlie. When the sea topped the bulwarks, what did it look"
like?â  I had my reasons for asking. A man of my acquaintance had
"once gone down with a leaking ship in a still sea, and had seen the"
water-level pause for an instant ere it fell on the deck.

"â It looked just like a banjo-string drawn tight, and it seemed to stay"
"there for years,â  said Charlie."

Exactly! The other man had said:

"â It looked like a silver wire laid down along the bulwarks, and I"
thought it was never going to break.â  He had paid everything except
"the bare life for this little valueless piece of knowledge, and I had"
traveled ten thousand weary miles to meet him and take his knowledge
"at second hand. But Charlie, the bank-clerk, on twenty-five shillings"
"a week, he who had never been out of sight of a London omnibus, knew"
it all. It was no consolation to me that once in his lives he had been
"forced to die for his gains. I also must have died scores of times, but"
"behind me, because I could have used my knowledge, the doors were shut."

"â And then?â  I said, trying to put away the devil of envy."

"â The funny thing was, though, in all the mess I didnâ t feel a bit"
astonished or frightened. It seemed as if Iâ d been in a good many
"fights, because I told my next man so when the row began. But that cad"
of an overseer on my deck wouldnâ t unloose our chains and give us a
"chance. He always said that weâ d all be set free after a battle, but we"
never were; We never were.â  Charlie shook his head mournfully.

â What a scoundrel!â 

"â I should say he was. He never gave us enough to eat, and sometimes"
we were so thirsty that we used to drink salt-water. I can taste that
salt-water still.â 

â Now tell me something about the harbor where the fight was fought.â 

"â I didnâ t dream about that. I know it was a harbor, though; because we"
were tied up to a ring on a white wall and all the face of the stone
under water was covered with wood to prevent our ram getting chipped
when the tide made us rock.â 

â Thatâ s curious. Our hero commanded the galley? Didnâ t he?â 

â Didnâ t he just! He stood by the bows and shouted like a good â€˜un. He
was the man who killed the overseer.â 

"â But you were all drowned together, Charlie, werenâ t you?â "

"â I canâ t make that fit quite,â  he said with a puzzled look. â The galley"
must have gone down with all hands and yet I fancy that the hero went on
living afterward. Perhaps he climbed into the attacking ship. I wouldnâ t
"see that, of course. I was dead, you know.â "

He shivered slightly and protested that he could remember no more.

"I did not press him further, but to satisfy myself that he lay in"
"ignorance of the workings of his own mind, deliberately introduced him"
"to Mortimer Collinsâ s â Transmigration,â  and gave him a sketch of the"
plot before he opened the pages.

"â What rot it all is!â  he said, frankly, at the end of an hour. â I donâ t"
"understand his nonsense about the Red Planet Mars and the King, and the"
rest of it. Chuck me the Longfellow again.â 

I handed him the book and wrote out as much as I could remember of his
"description of the sea-fight, appealing to him from time to time for"
confirmation of fact or detail. He would answer without raising his eyes
"from the book, as assuredly as though all his knowledge lay before flint"
on the printed page. I spoke under the normal key of my voice that the
"current might not be broken, and I know that he was not aware of what he"
"was saying, for his thoughts were out on the sea with Longfellow."

"â Charlie,â  I asked, â when the rowers on the galleys mutinied how did"
they kill their overseers?â 

â Tore up the benches and brained â€˜em. That happened when a heavy sea was
running. An overseer on the lower deck slipped from the centre plank and
fell among the rowers. They choked him to death against the side of the
"ship with their chained hands quite quietly, and it was too dark for the"
"other overseer to see what had happened. When he asked, he was pulled"
"down too and choked, and the lower deck fought their way up deck by"
"deck, with the pieces of the broken benches banging behind â€˜em. How they"
howled!â 

â And what happened after that?â 

â I donâ t know. The hero went away--red hair and red beard and all. That
"was after he had captured our galley, I think.â "

"The sound of my voice irritated him, and he motioned slightly with his"
left hand as a man does when interruption jars.

"â You never told me he was redheaded before, or that he captured your"
"galley,â  I said, after a discreet interval."

Charlie did not raise his eyes.

"â He was as red as a red bear,â  said he, abstractedly. â He came from the"
"north; they said so in the galley when he looked for rowers--not slaves,"
but free men. Afterward--years and years afterward--news came from
"another ship, or else he came back----â  His lips moved in silence. He"
was rapturously retasting some poem before him.

"â Where had he been, then?â  I was almost whispering that the sentence"
might come gentle to whichever section of Charlieâ s brain was working on
my behalf.

"â To the Beaches--the Long and Wonderful Beaches!â  was the reply, after a"
minute of silence.

"â To Furdurstrandi?â  I asked, tingling from head to foot."

"â Yes, to Furdurstrandi,â  he pronounced the word in a new fashion â And I"
too saw----â  The voice failed.

"â Do you know what you have said?â  I shouted, incautiously."

"He lifted his eyes, fully roused now. â No!â  he snapped. â I wish youâ d"
let a chap go on reading. Hark to this:

"â â€˜But Othere, the old sea captain,"
He neither paused nor stirred
"Till the king listened, and then"
â€˜Once more took up his pen
And wrote down every word.

â â€˜And to the King of the Saxons
"In witness of the truth,"
"Raising his noble head,"
"He stretched his brown hand and said,"
â Behold this walrus tooth.â 

"By Jove, what chaps those must have been, to go sailing all over the"
shop never knowing where theyâ d fetch the land! Hah!â 

"â Charlie,â  I pleaded, â if youâ ll only be sensible for a minute or two"
Iâ ll make our hero in our tale every inch as good as Othere.â 

â Umph! Longfellow wrote that poem. I donâ t care about writing things
"any more. I want to read.â  He was thoroughly out of tune now, and raging"
"over my own ill-luck, I left him."

Conceive yourself at the door of the worldâ s treasure-house guarded by a
child--an idle irresponsible child playing knuckle-bones--on whose favor
"depends the gift of the key, and you will imagine one-half my torment."
Till that evening Charlie had spoken nothing that might not lie within
"the experiences of a Greek galley-slave. But now, or there was no virtue"
"in books, he had talked of some desperate adventure of the Vikings, of"
"Thorfin Karlsefneâ s sailing to Wineland, which is America, in the ninth"
or tenth century. The battle in the harbor he had seen; and his own
death he had described. But this was a much more startling plunge into
the past. Was it possible that he had skipped half a dozen lives and was
then dimly remembering some episode of a thousand years later? It was
"a maddening jumble, and the worst of it was that Charlie Mears in his"
normal condition was the last person in the world to clear it up. I
"could only wait and watch, but I went to bed that night full of the"
wildest imaginings. There was nothing that was not possible if Charlieâ s
detestable memory only held good.

I might rewrite the Saga of Thorfin Karlsefne as it had never been
"written before, might tell the story of the first discovery of America,"
"myself the discoverer. But I was entirely at Charlieâ s mercy, and so"
long as there was a three-and-six-penny Bohn volume within his reach
Charlie would not tell. I dared not curse him openly; I hardly dared jog
"his memory, for I was dealing with the experiences of a thousand years"
"ago, told through the mouth of a boy of to-day; and a boy of to-day is"
"affected by every change of tone and gust of opinion, so that he lies"
even when he desires to speak the truth.

I saw no more of him for nearly a week. When next I met him it was in
Gracechurch Street with a billbook chained to his waist. Business took
him over London Bridge and I accompanied him. He was very full of the
importance of that book and magnified it. As we passed over the Thames
we paused to look at a steamerâ  unloading great slabs of white and brown
marble. A barge drifted under the steamerâ s stern and a lonely cow
in that barge bellowed. Charlieâ s face changed from the face of the
bank-clerk to that of an unknown and--though he would not have believed
this--a much shrewder man. He flung out his arm across the parapet of
"the bridge, and laughing very loudly, said:"

â When they heard  our  bulls bellow the Skroelings ran away!â 

"I waited only for an instant, but the barge and the cow had disappeared"
under the bows of the steamer before I answered.

"â Charlie, what do you suppose are Skroelings?â "

â Never heard of â€˜em before. They sound like a new kind of seagull. What
a chap you are for asking questions!â  he replied. â I have to go to the
cashier of the Omnibus Company yonder. Will you wait for me and we can
lunch somewhere together? Iâ ve a notion for a poem.â 

"â No, thanks. Iâ m off. Youâ re sure you know nothing about Skroelings?â "

â Not unless heâ s been entered for the Liverpool Handicap.â  He nodded and
disappeared in the crowd.

Now it is written in the Saga of Eric the Red or that of Thorfin
"Karlsefne, that nine hundred years ago when Karlsefneâ s galleys came"
"to Leifâ s booths, which Leif had erected in the unknown land"
"called Markland, which may or may not have been Rhode Island, the"
Skroelings--and the Lord He knows who these may or may not have
"been--came to trade with the Vikings, and ran away because they were"
frightened at the bellowing of the cattle which Thorfin had brought with
him in the ships. But what in the world could a Greek slave know of that
affair? I wandered up and down among the streets trying to unravel the
"mystery, and the more I considered it, the more baffling it grew. One"
thing only seemed certain and that certainty took away my breath for the
"moment. If I came to full knowledge of anything at all, it would not be"
"one life of the soul in Charlie Mearsâ s body, but half a dozen--half a"
dozen several and separate existences spent on blue water in the morning
of the world!

Then I walked round the situation.

Obviously if I used my knowledge I should stand alone and unapproachable
"until all men were as wise as myself. That would be something, but"
manlike I was ungrateful. It seemed bitterly unfair that Charlieâ s
memory should fail me when I needed it most. Great Powers above--I
looked up at them through the fog smoke--did the Lords of Life and Death
know what this meant to me? Nothing less than eternal fame of the
"best kind; that comes from One, and is shared by one alone. I would"
"be content--remembering Clive, I stood astounded at my own"
"moderation,--with the mere right to tell one story, to work out one"
little contribution to the light literature of the day. If Charlie were
permitted full recollection for one hour--for sixty short minutes--of
existences that had extended over a thousand years--I would forego all
profit and honor from all that I should make of his speech. I would take
no share in the commotion that would follow throughout the particular
corner of the earth that calls itself â the world.â  The thing should be
"put forth anonymously. Nay, I would make other men believe that they had"
written it. They would hire bull-hided self-advertising Englishmen to
"bellow it abroad. Preachers would found a fresh conduct of life upon it,"
swearing that it was new and that they had lifted the fear of death from
all mankind. Every Orientalist in Europe would patronize it discursively
with Sanskrit and Pali texts. Terrible women would invent unclean
variants of the menâ s belief for the elevation of their sisters.
Churches and religions would war over it. Between the hailing and
re-starting of an omnibus I foresaw the scuffles that would arise among
half a dozen denominations all professing â the doctrine of the True
"Metempsychosis as applied to the world and the New Eraâ ; and saw, too,"
"the respectable English newspapers shying, like frightened kine,"
over the beautiful simplicity of the tale. The mind leaped forward a
hundred--two hundred--a thousand years. I saw with sorrow that men would
mutilate and garble the story; that rival creeds would turn it upside
"down till, at last, the western world which clings to the dread of death"
"more closely than the hope of life, would set it aside as an interesting"
superstition and stampede after some faith so long forgotten that it
seemed altogether new. Upon this I changed the terms of the bargain that
"I would make with the Lords of Life and Death. Only let me know, let me"
"write, the story with sure knowledge that I wrote the truth, and I would"
burn the manuscript as a solemn sacrifice. Five minutes after the last
line was written I would destroy it all. But I must be allowed to write
it with absolute certainty.

There was no answer. The flaming colors of an Aquarium poster caught my
eye and I wondered whether it would be wise or prudent to lure Charlie
"into the hands of the professional mesmerist, and whether, if he were"
"under his power, he would speak of his past lives. If he did, and if"
"people believed him... but Charlie would be frightened and flustered, or"
"made conceited by the interviews. In either case he would begin to lie,"
through fear or vanity. He was safest in my own hands.

"â They are very funny fools, your English,â  said a voice at my elbow, and"
"turning round I recognized a casual acquaintance, a young Bengali law"
"student, called Grish Chunder, whose father had sent him to England to"
"become civilized. The old man was a retired native official, and on an"
income of five pounds a month contrived to allow his son two hundred
"pounds a year, and the run of his teeth in a city where he could pretend"
"to be the cadet of a royal house, and tell stories of the brutal Indian"
bureaucrats who ground the faces of the poor.

"Grish Chunder was a young, fat, full-bodied Bengali dressed with"
"scrupulous care in frock coat, tall hat, light trousers and tan gloves."
But I had known him in the days when the brutal Indian Government paid
"for his university education, and he contributed cheap sedition to"
" Sachi Durpan , and intrigued with the wives of his schoolmates."

"â That is very funny and very foolish,â  he said, nodding at the poster."
â I am going down to the Northbrook Club. Will you come too?â 

"I walked with him for some time. â You are not well,â  he said. â What is"
there in your mind? You do not talk.â 

"â Grish Chunder, youâ ve been too well educated to believe in a God,"
havenâ t you?â 

"â Oah, yes,  here ! But when I go home I must conciliate popular"
"superstition, and make ceremonies of purification, and my women will"
anoint idols.â 

"â And bang up  tulsi  and feast the  purohit , and take you back into"
"caste again and make a good  khuttrj  of you again, you advanced social"
"Free-thinker. And youâ ll eat  desi  food, and like it all, from the"
smell in the courtyard to the mustard oil over you.â 

"â I shall very much like it,â  said Grish Chunder, unguardedly. â Once a"
Hindu--always a Hindu. But I like to know what the English think they
know.â 

â Iâ ll tell you something that one Englishman knows. Itâ s an old tale to
you.â 

"I began to tell the story of Charlie in English, but Grish Chunder put"
"a question in the vernacular, and the history went forward naturally in"
the tongue best suited for its telling. After all it could never have
"been told in English. Grish Chunder heard me, nodding from time to time,"
and then came up to my rooms where I finished the tale.

"â  Beshak ,â  he said, philosophically. â  Lekin darwaza band hai. "
"(Without doubt, but the door is shut.) I have heard of this remembering"
of previous existences among my people. It is of course an old tale with
"us, but, to happen to an Englishman--a cow-fed  Malechk --an outcast. By"
"Jove, that is  most  peculiar!â "

"â Outcast yourself, Grish Chunder! You eat cow-beef every day. Letâ s"
think the thing over. The boy remembers his incarnations.â 

"â Does he know that?â  said Grish Chunder, quietly, swinging his legs as"
he sat on my table. He was speaking in English now.

â He does not know anything. Would I speak to you if he did? Go on!â 

â There is no going on at all. If you tell that to your friends they will
"say you are mad and put it in the papers. Suppose, now, you prosecute"
for libel.â 

â Letâ s leave that out of the question entirely. Is there any chance of
his being made to speak?â 

"â There is a chance. Oah, yes! But if he spoke it would mean that all"
this world would end now-- instanto --fall down on your head. These
"things are not allowed, you know. As I said, the door is shut.â "

â Not a ghost of a chance?â 

"â How can there be? You are a Christi-Ã¡n, and it is forbidden to eat, in"
"your books, of the Tree of Life, or else you would never die. How shall"
you all fear death if you all know what your friend does not know that
"he knows? I am afraid to be kicked, but I am not afraid to die, because"
"I know what I know. You are not afraid to be kicked, but you are afraid"
"to die. If you were not, by God! you English would be all over the shop"
"in an hour, upsetting the balances of power, and making commotions. It"
would not be good. But no fear. He will remember a little and a little
"less, and he will call it dreams. Then he will forget altogether. When"
I passed my First Arts Examination in Calcutta that was all in the
"cram-book on Wordsworth. â€˜Trailing clouds of glory,â  you know.â "

â This seems to be an exception to the rule.â 

â There are no exceptions to rules. Some are not so hard-looking as
"others, but they are all the same when you touch. If this friend of"
"yours said so-and-so and so-and-so, indicating that he remembered all"
"his lost lives, or one piece of a lost life, he would not be in the bank"
"another hour. He would be what you called sack because he was mad, and"
"they would send him to an asylum for lunatics. You can see that, my"
friend.â 

"â Of course I can, but I wasnâ t thinking of him. His name need never"
appear in the story.â 

â Ah! I see. That story will never be written. You can try.â 

â I am going to.â 

"â For your own credit and for the sake of money, of course?â "

â No. For the sake of writing the story. On my honor that will be all.â 

â Even then there is no chance. You cannot play with the Gods. It is a
"very pretty story now. As they say, Let it go on that--I mean at that."
Be quick; he will not last long.â 

â How do you mean?â 

"â What I say. He has never, so far, thought about a woman.â "

"â Hasnâ t he, though!â  I remembered some of Charlieâ s confidences."

â I mean no woman has thought about him. When that comes;
 bus -- hogya --all up! I know. There are millions of women here.
"Housemaids, for instance.â "

I winced at the thought of my story being ruined by a housemaid. And yet
nothing was more probable.

Grish Chunder grinned.

"â Yes--also pretty girls--cousins of his house, and perhaps not of his"
house. One kiss that he gives back again and remembers will cure all
"this nonsense, or else----â "

â Or else what? Remember he does not know that he knows.â 

"â I know that. Or else, if nothing happens he will become immersed in the"
trade and the financial speculations like the rest. It must be so. You
"can see that it must be so. But the woman will come first,  I  think.â "

"There was a rap at the door, and Charlie charged in impetuously. He had"
"been released from office, and by the look in his eyes I could see"
that he had come over for a long talk; most probably with poems in his
"pockets. Charlieâ s poems were very wearying, but sometimes they led him"
to talk about the galley.

Grish Chunder looked at him keenly for a minute.

"â I beg your pardon,â  Charlie said, uneasily; â I didnâ t know you had any"
one with you.â 

"â I am going,â  said Grish Chunder."

He drew me into the lobby as he departed.

"â That is your man,â  he said, quickly. â I tell you he will never speak"
all you wish. That is rot-bosh. But he would be most good to make to see
things. Suppose now we pretend that it was only playâ --I had never seen
"Grish Chunder so excited--â and pour the ink-pool into his hand. Eh, what"
do you think? I tell you that he could see  anything  that a man could
see. Let me get the ink and the camphor. He is a seer and he will tell
us very many things.â 

"â He may be all you say, but Iâ m not going to trust him to your Gods and"
devils.â 

â It will not hurt him. He will only feel a little stupid and dull when
he wakes up. You have seen boys look into the ink-pool before.â 

â That is the reason why I am not going to see it any more. Youâ d better
"go, Grish Chunder.â "

"He went, declaring far down the staircase that it was throwing away my"
only chance of looking into the future.

"This left me unmoved, for I was concerned for the past, and no peering"
of hypnotized boys into mirrors and ink-pools would help me do that. But
I recognized Grish Chunderâ s point of view and sympathized with it.

"â What a big black brute that was!â  said Charlie, when I returned to"
"him. â Well, look here, Iâ ve just done a poem; did it instead of playing"
dominoes after lunch. May I read it?â 

â Let me read it to myself.â 

"â Then you miss the proper expression. Besides, you always make my things"
sound as if the rhymes were all wrong.

"â Read it aloud, then. Youâ re like the rest of â€˜em.â "

"Charlie mouthed me his poem, and it was not much worse than the average"
"of his verses. He had been reading his book faithfully, but he was not"
pleased when I told him that I preferred my Longfellow undiluted with
Charlie.

Then we began to go through the MS. line by line; Charlie parrying every
objection and correction with:

"â Yes, that may be better, but you donâ t catch what Iâ m driving at.â "

"Charlie was, in one way at least, very like one kind of poet."

There was a pencil scrawl at the back of the paper and â Whatâ s that?â  I
said.

â Oh thatâ s not poetry â€˜t all. Itâ s some rot I wrote last night before I
went to bed and it was too much bother to hunt for rhymes; so I made it
a sort of a blank verse instead.â 

Here is Charlieâ s â blank verseâ :

â We pulled for you when the wind was against us and the sails
were low.

 Will you never let us go? 

We ate bread and onions when you took towns or ran aboard
quickly when you were beaten back by the foe.

The captains walked up and down the deck in fair weather singing
"songs, but we were below."

We fainted with our chins on the oars and you did not see that we
were idle for we still swung to and fro.

 Will you never let us go? 

The salt made the oar handles like sharkskin; our knees were cut to
the bone with salt cracks; our hair was stuck to our foreheads; and
our lips were cut to our gums and you whipped us because we
could not row.

 Will you never let us go? 

But in a little time we shall run out of the portholes as the water
"runs along the oarblade, and though you tell the others to row after"
us you will never catch us till you catch the oar-thresh and tie up
the winds in the belly of the sail. Aho!

 Will you never let us go? â 

"â Hâ m. Whatâ s oar-thresh, Charlie?â "

â The water washed up by the oars. Thatâ s the sort of song they might
"sing in the galley, yâ know. Arenâ t you ever going to finish that story"
and give me some of the profits?â 

â It depends on yourself. If you had only told me more about your hero in
the first instance it might have been finished by now. Youâ re so hazy in
your notions.â 

â I only want to give you the general notion of it--the knocking about
from place to place and the fighting and all that. Canâ t you fill in the
rest yourself? Make the hero save a girl on a pirate-galley and marry
her or do something.â 

â Youâ re a really helpful collaborator. I suppose the hero went through
some few adventures before he married.â 

"â Well then, make him a very artful card--a low sort of man--a sort"
of political man who went about making treaties and breaking them--a
black-haired chap who hid behind the mast when the fighting began.â 

â But you said the other day that he was red-haired.â 

â I couldnâ t have. Make him black-haired of course. Youâ ve no
imagination.â 

Seeing that I had just discovered the entire principles upon which the
"half-memory falsely called imagination is based, I felt entitled to"
"laugh, but forbore, for the sake of the tale."

â Youâ re right.  Youâ re  the man with imagination. A black-haired chap in
"a decked ship,â  I said."

"â No, an open ship--like a big boat.â "

This was maddening.

"â Your ship has been built and designed, closed and decked in; you said"
"so yourself,â  I protested."

"â No, no, not that ship. That was open, or half decked because----. By"
Jove youâ re right. You made me think of the hero as a red-haired chap.
"Of course if he were red, the ship would be an open one with painted"
sails.â 

"Surely, I thought he would remember now that he had served in two"
galleys at least--in a three-decked Greek one under the black-haired
"â political man,â  and again in a Vikingâ s open sea-serpent under the"
man â red as a red bearâ  who went to Markland. The devil prompted me to
speak.

"â Why, â€˜of course,â  Charlie?â  said I."

â I donâ t know. Are you making fun of me?â 

The current was broken for the time being. I took up a notebook and
pretended to make many entries in it.

"â Itâ s a pleasure to work with an imaginative chap like yourself,â  I said"
after a pause. â The way that youâ ve brought out the character of the
hero is simply wonderful.â 

"â Do you think so?â  he answered, with a pleased flush. â I often tell"
myself that thereâ s more in me than my mo--than people think.â 

â Thereâ s an enormous amount in you.â 

"â Then, wonâ t you let me send an essay on The Ways of Bank Clerks to"
"Tit-Bits, and get the guinea prize?â "

"â That wasnâ t exactly what I meant, old fellow: perhaps it would be"
better to wait a little and go ahead with the galley-story.â 

"â Ah, but I shaâ nâ t get the credit of that. â€˜Tit-Bitsâ  would publish my"
name and address if I win. What are you grinning at? They  would .â 

â I know it. Suppose you go for a walk. I want to look through my notes
about our story.â 

"Now this reprehensible youth who left me, a little hurt and put back,"
might for aught he or I knew have been one of the crew of the Argo--had
been certainly slave or comrade to Thorfin Karlsefne. Therefore he was
deeply interested in guinea competitions. Remembering what Grish Chunder
had said I laughed aloud. The Lords of Life and Death would never allow
"Charlie Mears to speak with full knowledge of his pasts, and I must even"
piece out what he had told me with my own poor inventions while Charlie
wrote of the ways of bank-clerks.

I got together and placed on one file all my notes; and the net result
was not cheering. I read them a second time. There was nothing that
might not have been compiled at second-hand from other peopleâ s
"books--except, perhaps, the story of the fight in the harbor. The"
adventures of a Viking had been written many times before; the history
"of a Greek galley-slave was no new thing, and though I wrote both, who"
could challenge or confirm the accuracy of my details? I might as well
tell a tale of two thousand years hence. The Lords of Life and Death
were as cunning as Grish Chunder had hinted. They would allow nothing
to escape that might trouble or make easy the minds of men. Though I
"was convinced of this, yet I could not leave the tale alone. Exaltation"
"followed reaction, not once, but twenty times in the next few weeks. My"
moods varied with the March sunlight and flying clouds. By night or in
the beauty of a spring morning I perceived that I could write that tale
"and shift continents thereby. In the wet, windy afternoons, I saw that"
"the tale might indeed be written, but would be nothing more than a"
"faked, false-varnished, sham-rusted piece of Wardour Street work at the"
end. Then I blessed Charlie in many ways--though it was no fault of his.
"He seemed to be busy with prize competitions, and I saw less and less of"
"him as the weeks went by and the earth cracked and grew ripe to spring,"
and the buds swelled in their sheaths. He did not care to read or talk
"of what he had read, and there was a new ring of self-assertion in"
his voice. I hardly cared to remind him of the galley when we met; but
"Charlie alluded to it on every occasion, always as a story from which"
money was to be made.

"â I think I deserve twenty-five per cent., donâ t I, at least,â  he said,"
"with beautiful frankness. â I supplied all the ideas, didnâ t I?â "

This greediness for silver was a new side in his nature. I assumed that
"it had been developed in the City, where Charlie was picking up the"
curious nasal drawl of the underbred City man.

â When the thingâ s done weâ ll talk about it. I canâ t make anything of it
at present. Red-haired or black-haired hero are equally difficult.â 

He was sitting by the fire staring at the red coals. â  I  canâ t
"understand what you find so difficult. Itâ s all as clean as mud to me,â "
"he replied. A jet of gas puffed out between the bars, took light and"
whistled softly. â Suppose we take the red-haired heroâ s adventures
"first, from the time that he came south to my galley and captured it and"
sailed to the Beaches.â 

I knew better now than to interrupt Charlie. I was out of reach of
"pen and paper, and dared not move to get them lest I should break the"
"current. The gas-jet puffed and whinnied, Charlieâ s voice dropped almost"
"to a whisper, and he told a tale of the sailing of an open galley to"
"Furdurstrandi, of sunsets on the open sea, seen under the curve of the"
one sail evening after evening when the galleyâ s beak was notched into
"the centre of the sinking disc, and â we sailed by that for we had no"
"other guide,â  quoth Charlie. He spoke of a landing on an island and"
"explorations in its woods, where the crew killed three men whom they"
"found asleep under the pines. Their ghosts, Charlie said, followed the"
"galley, swimming and choking in the water, and the crew cast lots and"
threw one of their number overboard as a sacrifice to the strange gods
whom they had offended. Then they ate sea-weed when their provisions
"failed, and their legs swelled, and their leader, the red-haired man,"
"killed two rowers who mutinied, and after a year spent among the woods"
"they set sail for their own country, and a wind that never failed"
carried them back so safely that they all slept at night. This and much
more Charlie told. Sometimes the voice fell so low that I could not
"catch the words, though every nerve was on the strain. He spoke of their"
"leader, the red-haired man, as a pagan speaks of his God; for it was he"
who cheered them and slew them impartially as he thought best for their
"needs; and it was he who steered them for three days among floating ice,"
"each floe crowded with strange beasts that â tried to sail with us,â  said"
"Charlie, â and we beat them back with the handles of the oars.â "

"The gas-jet went out, a burned coal gave way, and the fire settled down"
"with a tiny crash to the bottom of the grate. Charlie ceased speaking,"
and I said no word.

"â By Jove!â  he said, at last, shaking his head. â Iâ ve been staring at the"
fire till Iâ m dizzy. What was I going to say?â 

â Something about the galley.â 

"â I remember now. Itâ s 25 per cent. of the profits, isnâ t it?â "

â Itâ s anything you like when Iâ ve done the tale.â 

"â I wanted to be sure of that. I must go now. Iâ ve, Iâ ve an appointment.â "
And he left me.

Had my eyes not been held I might have know that that broken muttering
over the fire was the swan-song of Charlie Mears. But I thought it the
prelude to fuller revelation. At last and at last I should cheat the
Lords of Life and Death!

When next Charlie came to me I received him with rapture. He was nervous
"and embarrassed, but his eyes were very full of light, and his lips a"
little parted.

"â Iâ ve done a poem,â  he said; and then quickly: â itâ s the best Iâ ve ever"
done. Read it.â  He thrust it into my hand and retreated to the window.

I groaned inwardly. It would be the work of half an hour to
criticise--that is to say praise--the poem sufficiently to please
"Charlie. Then I had good reason to groan, for Charlie, discarding his"
"favorite centipede metres, had launched into shorter and choppier verse,"
and verse with a motive at the back of it. This is what I read:

"â The day is most fair, the cheery wind"
"Halloos behind the hill,"
"Where he bends the wood as seemeth good,"
And the sapling to his will!
Riot O wind; there is that in my blood
That would not have thee still!

"â She gave me herself, O Earth, O Sky;"
"Grey sea, she is mine alone!"
"Let the sullen boulders hear my cry,"
And rejoice thoâ  they be but stone!

"â Mine! I have won her, O good brown earth,"
Make merry! â€˜Tis hard on Spring;
Make merry; my love is doubly worth
All worship your fields can bring!
Let the bind that tills you feel my mirth
At the early harrowing.â 

"â Yes, itâ s the early harrowing, past a doubt,â  I said, with a dread at"
"my heart. Charlie smiled, but did not answer."

"â Red cloud of the sunset, tell it abroad;"
"I am victor. Greet me, O Sun,"
Dominant master and absolute lord
Over the soul of one!â 

"â Well?â  said Charlie, looking over my shoulder."

"I thought it far from well, and very evil indeed, when he silently laid"
"a photograph on the paper--the photograph of a girl with a curly head,"
and a foolish slack mouth.

"â Isnâ t it--isnâ t it wonderful?â  he whispered, pink to the tips of his"
"ears, wrapped in the rosy mystery of first love. â I didnâ t know; I"
didnâ t think--it came like a thunderclap.â 

"â Yes. It comes like a thunderclap. Are you very happy, Charlie?â "

â My God--she--she loves me!â  He sat down repeating the last words to
"himself. I looked at the hairless face, the narrow shoulders already"
"bowed by desk-work, and wondered when, where, and how he had loved in"
his past lives.

"â What will your mother say?â  I asked, cheerfully."

â I donâ t care a damn what she says.â 

"At twenty the things for which one does not care a damn should,"
"properly, be many, but one must not include mothers in the list. I told"
"him this gently; and he described Her, even as Adam must have described"
to the newly named beasts the glory and tenderness and beauty of Eve.
Incidentally I learned that She was a tobacconistâ s assistant with a
"weakness for pretty dress, and had told him four or five times already"
that She had never been kissed by a man before.

"Charlie spoke on, and on, and on; while I, separated from him by"
"thousands of years, was considering the beginnings of things. Now I"
understood why the Lords of Life and Death shut the doors so carefully
behind us. It is that we may not remember our first wooings. Were it not
"so, our world would be without inhabitants in a hundred years."

"â Now, about that galley-story,â  I said, still more cheerfully, in a"
pause in the rush of the speech.

Charlie looked up as though he had been hit. â The galley--what galley?
"Good heavens, donâ t joke, man! This is serious! You donâ t know how"
serious it is!â 

Grish Chunder was right. Charlie had tasted the love of woman that kills
"remembrance, and the finest story in the world would never be written."

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
"including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists"
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
"assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tmâ s"
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
"remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project"
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

"and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4"

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
"($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt"
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
"considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up"
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
"have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition"
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

"International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make"
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
"ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations."
"To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate"


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
"with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project"
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
"editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S."
"unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily"
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

"Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to"
